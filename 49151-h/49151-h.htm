<h2>MEMOIR OF JOHN FARMER, M. A.,</h2>

<p class="center">LATE CORRESPONDING SECRETARY OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE HISTORICAL SOCIETY.</p>


<p>John Farmer, who was the most distinguished Genealogist and
Antiquary of this country, was born at Chelmsford, Ms., June 12,
1789.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He was the eldest son of John Farmer, who married, January
24, 1788, Lydia Richardson, daughter of Josiah Richardson
of Chelmsford, Ms. His father was the son of Oliver Farmer, born
July 31, 1728, who was the son of Edward, born at Ansley, Warwickshire,
England, who emigrated to this country about the year
1670, and settled at Billerica, Ms.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Farmer inherited a feeble constitution. From early life till
death, his appearance was that of a person in the last stage of a
consumption. But notwithstanding his great bodily infirmity, he
was enabled by his industry and perseverance to accomplish
wonders.</p>

<p>From childhood, he was fond of books and study; ever diligent
as a scholar, and excelling most of his school-fellows in his acquisitions
of knowledge. Hours which, during recess or vacation, the
more hardy and robust would spend in athletic games and youthful
sports, he was disposed to employ in poring over books of history,
geography and chronology, inquiring after ancient records and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>papers, looking into the genealogy of families, and copying and
treasuring up anecdotes and traditions of Indians and Revolutionary
struggles. In his fondness for writing, and for copying
antiquarian, civil, ecclesiastical and literary matters, he almost
insensibly acquired a beautiful style of penmanship, which gave to
all his manuscripts a peculiar air of neatness and grace. A favorite
of the clergyman of his native place, he was allowed free access
to his books and papers, and thus he imbibed those impressions of
filial respect for the ministers of the gospel, which he exhibited on
all occasions through life. He regarded, with great reverence, the
clerical profession, looking upon the ministers of the cross as
indeed "the messengers of God."</p>

<p>At the age of sixteen, he became a clerk in a store at Amherst,
N.&nbsp;H. Here he remained five years, giving diligent attention to
the business of his employers, and devoting his leisure hours to
literary studies and correspondence. In a letter to the Rev. Hezekiah
Packard, D. D., who had been his teacher before he went to
Amherst, Mr. Farmer spoke with affection and gratitude of his
early Instructor; and in a reply, dated Wiscasset, Me., Dec. 4,
1809, the Doctor says, "If any of my friendly and religious counsels,
or any books I put into your hands, made deep and lasting
impressions upon your tender mind, you will join me in giving
praise and glory to God and the Redeemer. I can truly say of my
pupils, as St. John did of those he had converted to the Christian
faith, 'I have no greater joy than seeing them walking in the
truth.' I am much pleased with the account you give of your
industry and progress. If you have no idea of a college education,
it might appear as useful to you to become more familiar with
your favorite branches, geography, history, the constitutions of our
State governments and that of our common country, as well as
with the origin and progress of wars, and other calamities of the
eastern world." No pupil, probably, ever more highly valued an
instructor, than did young Farmer; and that he placed a high
estimate upon the teachings of Dr. Packard, is sufficiently shown
by his affectionate remembrance of him, and by his pursuits in
after life, and the results of his many labors.</p>

<p>In the course of the year 1810, finding the labors of his station
too arduous for his feeble health, Mr. Farmer left the store, and
engaged in teaching school, an employment in which he is said to
have greatly excelled. Two or three years previous to this, a literary
association for mutual improvement was formed at Amherst,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the members of which met weekly for debate, the rehearsal of
pieces, and reading original compositions. Of this society, Mr.
Farmer was for about eleven years the chief supporter, contributing
largely to the interest and usefulness of the meetings by his
own performances, and by inviting and attracting to it the young
men of promise that were about him. The neighboring clergy
were made honorary members of it, and frequently attended its
meetings, and participated in the discussions.</p>

<p>While engaged in school-keeping, Mr. Farmer cultivated his
natural taste, and pursued, with industry, historical inquiries. In
1813, becoming known to some of the Members of the Massachusetts
Historical Society, he was elected a Corresponding Member
of it, and immediately became a contributor to its Collections, which
have been published. In 1816, he published, in a pamphlet form,
his "Historical Sketch of Billerica," and furnished many valuable
facts towards the materials for the History of Chelmsford, afterwards
published by the Rev. Mr. Allen. In 1820, he published
"An Historical Sketch of Amherst from the first settlement of the
town," in pamphlet form. In these two publications, the marked
peculiarities of his mind are strongly exhibited. He evinced a
memory wonderfully tenacious of particular facts, dates, and names,
sound judgment in collecting, selecting, and arranging his materials,
and an exquisite niceness and exactness in all the details of these
histories.</p>

<p>About this time, Mr. Farmer commenced the study of medicine
with Dr. Matthias Spalding, an eminent Physician of Amherst;
but after a few months, foreseeing that he should be unfitted to
discharge the laborious duties of the profession, he relinquished the
study; and in 1821, removed to Concord. He there formed a connection
in business with Dr. Samuel Morril, and opened an apothecary's
store, from which circumstance he received the title of <em>Doctor</em>.
His feeble health not allowing any kind of hard manual
labor, or exposure to the changes of weather out of doors, he, partly
of necessity and partly of choice, adopted a very sedentary mode
of life. He was rarely away from his place of residence. He
deemed it hazardous for him to leave home. In 1836, however,
after a lapse of eighteen years, he visited Boston, where he was
treated with marked respect and attention by the <em>literati</em> of the
city; but was quite ill, while there, and unable to enjoy very much
of what he expected from his visit. He soon returned home,
restored to comparative health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>From the time of his removal to Concord, Mr. Farmer devoted
himself <em>principally</em> to what had become his favorite studies and
pursuits. He gathered together books of ancient date, early records
of the towns, and notices of the first settlers of the country; inquired
into the names, ages, characters and deaths of distinguished men
of every profession; and entered into extensive correspondence with
individuals who might be able to furnish him with facts, relating to
the subjects of his inquiry. In short, he soon became known as an
Antiquary, distinguished beyond any of his fellow-citizens, for exact
knowledge of facts and events relative to the history of New Hampshire,
and of New England generally. His mind was a wonderful
repository of names, and dates, and particular incidents; and so
general and well established was his reputation for accuracy of
memory, that his authority was relied on as decisive in historical
and genealogical facts. And though at times, he might have been
inaccurate, it is to be remembered, that, while he was the greatest
Genealogist and Antiquary of the country, he was also the <em>Pioneer</em>
in this department of knowledge; and while some, who shall
follow him, may <em>occasionally</em> discover a mistake, the <em>honor</em> of <em>this</em>
is not to be compared to the <em>honor</em> of <em>projecting</em> and <em>executing</em>
such works as Mr. Farmer's.</p>

<p>In 1822, Mr. Farmer, in connection with Jacob B. Moore, Esq.,
commenced a Periodical Miscellany, devoted principally to, "1. Historical
Sketches of Indian wars, battles, and exploits; of the
adventures and sufferings of the captives: 2. Topographical Descriptions
of towns and places in New Hampshire, with their history,
civil and ecclesiastical: 3. Biographical Memoirs and Anecdotes of
eminent and remarkable persons who lived in New Hampshire, or
who have had connection with its settlement and history: 4. Statistical
Tables; Tables of Births, Diseases, and Deaths: 5. Meteorological
Observations, and facts relating to climate." Three volumes
of this work were published.</p>

<p>In the same year he received the honorary degree of Master of
Arts from Dartmouth College; and in the following year he was
complimented with the appointment of Justice of the Peace for the
newly constituted county of Merrimack, but he did not deem the
office of sufficient importance, ever to act under his commission.</p>

<p>The New Hampshire Historical Society was established, May
20, 1823; and, although Mr. Farmer was unable to be present at
any of the early meetings of its founders, he took a deep interest
in its establishment, and contributed much towards its organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and success. Though he was never more than once or twice
present at the meetings of the Society, yet he never failed to communicate
with the members, by letter or otherwise, on such occasions.
He was Corresponding Secretary of the Society till his
death, the duties of which office he discharged with rare ability
and fidelity. Of the five volumes of Collections, published by the
Society, he was on the Publishing Committee of four. The fifth
volume was wholly compiled by him, and all the preceding volumes
are enriched by his contributions.</p>

<p>In 1823, Mr. Farmer, with an associate, Jacob B. Moore, Esq.,
published "A Gazetteer of the State of New Hampshire, comprehending,
1. A concise description of the several towns in the
State, in relation to their boundaries, divisions, mountains, lakes,
ponds: 2. The early history of each town; names of the first
settlers, and what were their hardships and adventures; instances
of longevity, or of great mortality; and short biographical notices
of the most distinguished and useful men: 3. A concise notice of
the formation of the first churches in the several towns; the names
of those who have been successively ordained as ministers, and
the time of their settlement, removal or death: 4. Also, notices of
permanent charitable and other institutions, literary societies, &amp;c."
This work was one of immense labor.</p>

<p>Mr. Farmer's published works are very numerous; and, considering
his infirm state of health during the whole seventeen years of
his residence in Concord, those who best knew him were surprised
at the extent and variety of his labors. The following is believed
to be an accurate list of his productions, with the exception of his
occasional contributions to the newspapers, or other ephemeral
publications.</p>

and Memoirs of Ministers who have graduated at Harvard College

</ol>

<p>It will be obvious that these works required severe labor and
unwearied care in their preparation. Of Mr. Farmer's edition of
Belknap's History of New Hampshire it is sufficient to say, that
the work is very much improved by the Annotator, who has embodied
a great mass of valuable matter in his notes relative to the
subjects of which he treated. It was his intention to have prepared
a second volume for the press, and he had collected a mass of
materials for the work, but did not live to accomplish his design.</p>

<p>The Genealogical Register is a most wonderful exhibition of
persevering industry. It may justly be called his <em>great work</em>, both
on account of the quantity of matter which it contains and the
difficulty of tracing out branches of families, where we have no
regular genealogy. It embraces many thousands of names of
persons, with dates of birth, death, offices sustained, places of residence,
&amp;c., chiefly through the seventeenth century. For one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
is fond of genealogical investigations, there is no treasure-house
like it. There are but a few surnames found in New England,
during the two centuries of our existence, which do not there
appear. Had Mr. Farmer published nothing else, this would
remain a lasting monument of his patient research and marvellous
accuracy. He has left a corrected copy of his Register, greatly
enlarged by successive additions, corrections, and illustrations. He
has also left several valuable manuscripts, more or less complete,
containing Sketches of deceased Lawyers, Physicians, Counsellors,
and Senators in New Hampshire; Tables of Mortality and Longevity;
Memoirs of more than two thousand early graduates of Harvard
College, and also of many graduates of Dartmouth College. Those
of Dartmouth College consist only of a few memoranda of those
individuals who received their degrees prior to 1799.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>A great labor, and the one on which Mr. Farmer had been
engaged for a considerable time previous to his death, was the
examining and arranging of the State Papers at Concord. Under
a resolution of the Legislature of New Hampshire, approved Jan.
3, 1837, he was appointed to "examine, arrange, index, prepare
for, and superintend the binding, and otherwise preserving, such of
the public papers in the archives of the State, as may be deemed
worthy of such care." Of this species of labor, no one knows the
extent and difficulty, unless he has either himself been versed in it,
or has frequently watched its progress when undertaken by others.
Mr. Farmer, in a letter to a distinguished literary friend in Massachusetts,
written in August, 1837, says, in reference to it, "that he
has had a great burden resting on him for the last four or five
months;" and adds, "the records and files were in great confusion,
no attempt having been made for arranging and binding a regular
series of the former or for properly labelling and classifying the latter.
In a few cases, I believe, there were papers of three centuries
in the same bundle. This will serve to give you an idea of the
confusion in which I found them. I began first with the Province
Records, arranged under three different heads: 1. Journals of the
House; 2. Journals of the Council and Assembly; 3. Journals of
the Council. The Journals of the House received my first attention.
These I found to commence in 1711, and from that time to
1775, they existed in twenty different portions, some in leaves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
in mere paper books, of a few sheets each. Only three or four
were bound volumes. I arranged the whole so as to make eight
volumes; copying about three hundred pages, which would not
conform in size. These have been bound in Russia leather, with
spring backs, and make a handsome array of folios, containing
3,813 pages. The Council and Assembly Records, beginning 1699
and ending 1774, in five volumes, large folio, and containing 2,260
pages, next were arranged, and are now ready for the binder. The
Council records are imperfect, and it will be necessary to copy much
from the files before they are ready to bind. Besides these, I have
collected the speeches and messages of the Provincial Governors,
from 1699 to 1775, arranged them in chronological order, and have
had them bound in three handsome volumes of about 1,500 pages.
I will not mention the amount of papers in files which I have been
over, new folded, and labelled."</p>

<p>Governor Hill, in his annual message to the Legislature, in June,
1837, says: "Under the resolution of the last session, John Farmer,
Esq., has for several weeks been engaged in arranging for binding and
preservation the shattered records and public papers in the archives
of this State. Perhaps a century may occur before another person
with his peculiar tact and talent shall appear to undertake this
work. Although of extremely feeble health, there is not probably
any other person in the State, who can readily perform so much&mdash;none
so well versed in its history, and who has like him traced
from the root upwards, the rise and progress of government in the
land of the Pilgrims, and the origin and spread of every considerable
family name in New England."</p>

<p>And in his message of June, 1838, Governor Hill thus speaks:
"In my last annual communication to the Legislature, the progress
made in the examination and arrangement of our public archives,
by John Farmer, Esq., was mentioned. Since that time, with a
method and perseverance deserving high praise, Mr. Farmer has
prosecuted his labors, until the appropriation then made has been
exhausted, and a small additional expense incurred. Twenty-three
volumes have been bound in a neat and substantial manner.
Among these volumes, is one containing the Associated Test
Returns, which has the original signatures of 8,199 citizens of this
State, above the age of twenty-one years, who 'solemnly engaged
and promised that they would to the utmost of their power, at the
risk of their lives and fortunes, with arms, oppose the hostile proceedings
of the British fleets and armies against the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
American Colonies.' This pledge, it should be remembered, preceded
the Declaration of Independence several months. It was,
therefore, in the language of a note prefixed by Mr. Farmer, to this
volume, 'a bold and hazardous step, in subjects, thus to resist the
authority of one of the most powerful sovereigns in the world.
Had the cause in which these men pledged their lives and fortunes
failed, it would have subjected every individual who signed it, to
the pains and penalties of treason; to a cruel and ignominious
death.' In my opinion, the cost to the State of this enterprise, by
the man of all others best qualified for such an undertaking, bears
no comparison to its importance: it is hoped the Legislature will
direct Mr. Farmer to persevere until he completes the work. Let
every fragment of our history be preserved; let us suffer nothing
to be lost."</p>

<p>The Legislature wisely responded to the suggestions of the
Governor. Mr. Farmer was continued in the work; and his life
was prolonged until he had accomplished the most difficult portion
of the task confided to him.</p>

<p>We know that Mr. Farmer placed an humble estimate upon his
labors. He well understood the general indifference of the public
to pursuits of this nature. The direction of the living and moving
crowd is onward; and he who busies himself in gathering up the
memorials of the past, will be left behind,&mdash;himself and his labors
too generally unrewarded and forgotten. Mr. Farmer has done
perhaps more than any other individual in collecting and preserving
the materials for our local history, and establishing accuracy in its
details. He investigated faithfully, took nothing upon trust, and
rested on reasonable conclusions only where absolute certainty
could not be attained. Many have expressed surprise that Mr.
Farmer could have been so indefatigable and painstaking in his
pursuits. But the fondness for these investigations grows with
indulgence. Success in establishing an old fact is a triumph over
time. Facts established are the warp and woof of history; and
the diligent antiquary thus gives to history its main materials,
veracity and fidelity, when enlightened philosophy steps in and
completes the work.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned, that Mr. Farmer was one of the
three or four gentlemen only in New Hampshire, who have been
elected Corresponding Members of the Massachusetts Historical
Society. He was also a Corresponding Member of the Rhode
Island and Maine Historical Societies, and of the American Anti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>quarian
Society. He was also elected in August, 1837, a member
of the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries at Copenhagen.</p>

<p>There was scarcely a lovelier or more prominent trait in Mr.
Farmer's character, than the ever fresh and affectionate interest
which he took in the intellectual improvement and moral culture
of the young. Having no family of his own to engage his
kind and generous affections, a chief source of happiness to him
seemed to be, to act the part of a father and teacher to all the youth
who were about him. He encouraged lyceums and literary associations
for mental improvement; often heard recitations in private;
examined compositions written at his own suggestion; and
directed the studies of such as applied to him. And such was his
suavity of manners, his instructive conversation, and inexhaustible
store of historical anecdote, that he scarcely ever failed to inspire
his pupils and intimate acquaintances with a portion of his taste for
literary and historical pursuits. Those who knew him respected
him. Those who knew him intimately and were his friends, loved
him. He was no dogmatist; never a violent partisan, although
decided in his opinions, on whatever subject he expressed them.
He possessed native delicacy and refinement of character. No
harsh expressions fell from his lips or proceeded from his pen. He
was nevertheless quick and sensitive to the distinctions between
right and wrong, and steadily threw his influence into the scale of
truth. His was a gentle spirit, seeking quiet and affection, like
Cowper's, though without his vein of melancholy; and, though
instinctively shrinking from vice, he was not disposed harshly to
visit the offender. He had zeal, but it was the zeal of a catholic
spirit, and of kind affections&mdash;the spirit of the Christian and gentleman,
which respected the feelings of others, in whatever situation
or circumstances of life.</p>

<p>All who were acquainted with Mr. Farmer, will respond to the
affectionate and just tribute, which fell from the lips of the Rev. Mr.
Bouton, on the occasion of his funeral: "We believe our departed
friend and fellow-citizen possessed the spirit of a Christian. Owing
to bodily weakness and infirmities, he could not attend public worship
on the Sabbath, or be present at any public meeting. But
we know he was a firm believer in the doctrines of Christianity; a
regular contributor to the support of divine worship; an intelligent
and frequent reader of the Holy Scriptures; and that he ever cherished
and manifested the profoundest reverence for the institutions
and ordinances of religion, and particularly a respect for Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
ministers of every denomination, whose conduct became their profession.
His spirit and views were eminently catholic. He loved
the good of every name, and cheerfully united with them in all
approved efforts and measures for the advancement of truth and
righteousness." He annually contributed to the Bible, Missionary,
and other Charitable Societies; and no man living, perhaps, felt a
deeper interest in the success of the great enterprises of Christian
benevolence, than did Mr. Farmer.</p>

<p>His last sickness was short. Few of his friends were aware of
his danger, till it was evident that he could not long survive. Many
gladly offered their services to wait upon him, and watch around
his dying-bed; but the privilege of this was reserved to a few
early-chosen friends. He wanted to be still and tranquil. To a
dear friend, who stood by him, to watch every motion and meet
every wish, he expressed peace of mind, and consolation in the
hope of eternal life through Jesus Christ. On the evening of the
Sabbath before his decease, he desired the same friend to sing to
him a favorite hymn, which she did. His reason remained unclouded
to the last, and he gently fell asleep in death, at a few
minutes past 6 o'clock, on Monday morning, the 13th of August,
1838, in the 49th year of his age.</p>

<p>Upon the plain white marble stone, marking the place where the
mortal remains of Mr. Farmer lie, is the following inscription:</p>

<p class="center">  "John Farmer, born at Chelmsford, Mass., 22 June, 1789; Died in this town, 13 August, 1838; &AElig;t. 49 years.<br />
                      Honored as a man;<br />
        Distinguished as an Antiquarian and Scholar;<br />

            And revered as a Christian Philanthropist;<br />
                And a lover of impartial liberty;<br />
            His death has occasioned a void in Society,<br />

<h2>GENEALOGICAL MEMOIR OF THE FARMER FAMILY.</h2>

<p class="center">Remodelled and Prepared on a New Plan.</p>

<p class="center">BY SAMUEL G. DRAKE, M. A.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[As one of this name has very justly been styled "The Father of Genealogy in New
England," and has left behind him an enduring monument of his labors in this department of
literature, it is deemed highly proper to commence our Genealogical Series with that of his
family. It will be viewed, we doubt not, with great interest, by all lovers of such subjects,
and more especially as the Memoir is from his own pen; that is to say, as to facts, it is
entirely the same as that, which was published by the distinguished Genealogist himself; but
the plan of it here presented, is new, and is probably preferable to any other hitherto adopted.
Indeed there does not appear to have been any general fixed plan for the exhibition of Genealogies.
The following method, the result of much reflection, is now offered for the consideration
of those who may engage in preparing Genealogical Memoirs. <span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p></div>


<p class="center"><em>Explanation of the Plan.</em></p>

<p>As the plan laid down may not be apparent at first view, the following explanation
may be deemed necessary. The Arabic numbers running through the
whole Genealogy, are to show not only the number of every individual
descended from the same ancestor, but by the aid of them, the connection of
every person is seen at a glance, and the ancestors or descendants may be
traced, backward or forward, with the greatest ease and facility. One number
set under another, or two numbers set against the same individual, show, in all
cases, that such individual has descendants, and the lower number indicates the
place in the series where the descendants are to be found; remembering that
the Roman numerals are only employed to show the number of children
belonging to the same particular family. For example, (18)/(59) VIII. <span class="smcap">Oliver</span>,<sup>3</sup>
shows, that this person is No. 18 in the regular Arabic series, and that following
(59), onward, his family will be found; the VIII is sufficiently obvious. The <sup>3</sup>
at the end of the name, denotes the individual to be of the 3rd generation from
the first in the series, and so of all other numbers in a similar situation; i. e., all
those placed like an exponent at the end of names, show the generation. All
names of persons having descendants, are necessarily repeated, in their order,
but are not renumbered. Thus <span class="smcap">John</span><sup>3</sup> (10) is repeated after 18, the (10) showing
his original place in the series.</p>

<p>From what is said above it is thought the plan will be perfectly apparent on
the most cursory perusal. The names of persons descended in the female line
are printed in the ordinary Roman letter, to distinguish them from those of the
male line, always printed in small capitals.</p>

<p>By this system of deducing or displaying descents, any corrections or additions
may be made without disfiguring the appearance of the work, as for
instance, (63) IV. <span class="smcap">Sarah</span>,<sup>4</sup> whose family is indicated to be given at (126); it
will appear that other individuals were found belonging to her family after the
work was made up, therefore a new entry is made of her at (164), and yet all
is perfectly clear.</p>

<p>Although it is highly desirable, that individuals and families should succeed
each other in the regular order of their generations, it is not always possible to
make a genealogical memoir so; for it is apparent that in numerous instances,
especially among the early families, we are obliged to pass over individuals, not
knowing whether they had descendants; and when a long memoir is made up it is
often found that many so passed over, had children. These therefore cannot
have their proper place in the memoir without great labor, requiring a new draft
of nearly the whole work. By the plan now presented we avoid the difficulty, in
its most objectionable feature, by placing all such at the end of the memoir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
whenever we find them, with the same numerical references, &amp;c., as employed
throughout. Thus, in the following genealogy we have several placed in this
manner for illustration; as for example, (110) III. <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span><sup>6</sup> falls into the
series, with her descendants at (174), while (83) I. <span class="smcap">Edward</span><sup>5</sup> does not fall in
till (176), and so of a few others.</p>

<p>In preparing this memoir the reader must remember, that the author published
it in 1828, and hence, that the present tense often used by him, has reference
to the date of publication. We make this note to avoid too frequent
interpolations in brackets. Mr. Farmer had printed in 1813, sundry Family
Records of different branches of the family, and in 1824, he issued an Appendix
to it. This with the other part made about 30 pages in 18mo. These contained
a good deal not found in his last work. All three are here incorporated into a
regular and continuous genealogy. The copies of the first two printed works
which I have used, have many manuscript additions and corrections in the
author's own hand. The title-page of the Memoir runs thus:</p>

<h3>MEMOIR.</h3>

<p>The surname of <span class="smcap">Farmer</span> is one of considerable antiquity, and is
one of those names derived from occupations or professions, which,
next to local names, or those derived from the names of places, are
the most numerous.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It comes from the Saxon term <i lang="ang">Fearme</i> or
<i lang="ang">Feorme</i>, which signifies food or provision.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> But some think it derived
from <i lang="ang">Firma</i>, which signifies a place enclosed or shut in; and some
contend for its French etymology from the word <i lang="fr">Ferme</i>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Farmers</span>, so far as my researches will enable me to conjecture,
were of Saxon origin, and, in the reign of Edward IV., King of England,
were seated in Northamptonshire, where they remain to the
present day. They resided at Easton-Neston about 1480. Anne, the
daughter of Richard Farmer, Esq., of that place, married, before 1545,
William Lucy, and their son, Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote, knighted
by Queen Elizabeth, in 1565, was the knight and magistrate whose
name is associated with some of the early events of the life of
Shakspeare. William Farmer, created Lord Leinster in 1692, the
ancestor of the present earl of Pomfret, resided at Easton-Neston.
Jasper Farmer, one of this family, is said to be the ancestor of the
Farmers in the State of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>From Northamptonshire they seem to have spread over several of
the contiguous counties before the middle of the sixteenth century;
being found in Leicestershire as early as 1490, in Warwickshire in
1545, and in Shropshire at nearly the same period.</p>

<p>Sir William Dugdale, in his Antiquities of Warwickshire, mentions
Richard Farmer and his wife, and John their son, and Maud his wife,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>to whom, and the heirs male of the said John, the place or parish of
Merston-Boteler in that county, was granted by the King's Letters
Patent, dated November 23, 1545. He also names Rev. Thomas
Farmer, minister of the parish of Austrey in 1542, and Rev. John
Farmer, incumbent of the church in Bagington, 1552, and Rev. Richard,
of the parish of Ashowe.</p>

<p>R. Farmer, Esq., of Kennington Common, near London, informs
me,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that his ancestors as far back as he had been able to trace them,
belonged to Oldbury, near Bridgenorth, in Shropshire, and that their
names were Edward. Thomas Farmer, Esq., one of the Managers of
the British and Foreign Bible Society, is of this family. Rev. Hugh
Farmer, the learned author of the Dissertation on Miracles, and other
theological works, was of Shropshire, and was born at a place called
Isle Gate, belonging to a small hamlet almost surrounded by the river
Severn, a few miles from Shrewsbury.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The branch of the family traced in the following pages was formerly
seated in Leicestershire, on the borders of Warwickshire; and, about
1500, were living in the village of Ratcliffe-Cuiley, near Witherly. Of
those who resided there at that period, I am unable to speak with any
degree of certainty, having the advantage of no records, or family
memorials. The late Rev. Richard Farmer, D. D., of Cambridge,
England, made some collections of a genealogical nature, and from
these it would seem, that the most remote ancestor, whom he had
traced, was <span class="smcap">Edward</span>, who is mentioned by Anthony Wood in his
Athen&aelig; Oxonienses, and in his Fasti Oxonienses, as being the Chancellor
of the Cathedral church in Salisbury, in 1531; which office he
sustained until his death in 1538.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Farmer</span> is the next ancestor of whom I have any account,
and of whom I have nothing more than the fact found among Rev. Dr.
Farmer's MSS., that he was living at Ansley in Warwickshire in 1604.
Between him and Edward of Salisbury, there were probably two or
three generations, whose names cannot be given with much confidence,
although it is presumed from Guillim's Heraldry, that the name of one
was Bartholomew.</p>

<p>There has been a considerable number of the name in England,
and several of them of the Warwickshire branch of the family, who
have been employed in public life, or have been known by their writings.
The following list of them has been collected from various
sources:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span>, who was appointed in 1687, by James II., President of
Magdalen College; but, being a papist, and there being other objections

<p><span class="smcap">Edward.</span> "In the year 1529, in the beginning of February,

    <td>of Ansley, who m. Isabella Barbage of Great Packington, in Warwickshire, is the first ancestor of whom I have the means of giving any account, supported by original documents and family memorials in my possession. Ansley, the place of his residence, is a small village in the northerly part of the county of Warwick, situated <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>about ten miles from the city of Coventry, four from Atherstone, which borders on Leicestershire, and five from Nuneaton, a considerable market town, and has a population of 541. In this place, and near Ansley Hall,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the seat of the Ludfords, he owned houses and lands, which passed to his posterity through several generations, and may still be owned by his descendants. Of his family I have procured some facts, which will be given. He died before the year 1669, and Isabella, his widow, came with some of her children to New England, a few years after this period, and m. Elder Thomas Wiswall of Cambridge Village, now Newton, who d. Dec. 6, 1683. She d. at Billerica, May 21, 1686, at an advanced age.<br />

He afterwards lived a year or two at Woburn, and one of his children was born there. In Billerica he was chosen to several of the most important town offices, and was employed in public service, until he was quite advanced in life. He had 8 children, 4 sons and 4 daughters. To his youngest son, Oliver, he gave the farm on which he resided, which is still in possession of one of his descendants. On this farm have resided 6 successive generations, in the space of 154 years. He died at Billerica, May 27, 1727, a. about 87. Mary his wife d. March 26, 1716, a. 77. The male descendants of Edward Farmer, of the patronymic name, have nearly all been agriculturists, and no one among them has attained any considerable civil or literary distinction. In the female line of descent there have been several of liberal education, and others who have been honored with civil office.<br />
    The house of <span class="smcap">Edward Farmer</span>, (which stood until after 1728,) was fortified as a garrison for a number of years. While occupied as such, the following incident <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>occurred, which has been handed down by tradition in the family. During the Ten Years' Indian War, and probably about the year 1692, when the first depredations were committed in the town of Billerica, the Indians meditated an attack on this garrison. For some days they had been lurking in the neighborhood of it without being discovered. Early in the forenoon of a summer's day, the wife and daughter of Edward Farmer went into the field to gather peas or beans for dinner, being attended by several of her sons, who were young lads, as a guard to protect them. They had been out but a short time before Mrs. Farmer discovered that a number of Indians were concealed behind the fences, and so near that she could almost reach them. Had she given any alarm, they would probably have rushed from their lurking-places, seized the party and fled; although their object was to get possession of the garrison, which offered more plunder and a greater number of captives. But with admirable presence of mind, and without making known the discovery she had made, to her sons, who might, with more temerity than prudence, have attacked the Indians, she said, in a loud tone of voice, "Boys, guard us well to the garrison, and then you may come back and hunt Indians." The Indians, supposing they were not discovered, remained in their hiding-places, while the other party soon left the field for the garrison, which they reached in safety. Then the alarm was given, the people collected, and the Indians fled with precipitation. After the return of peace, the Indians declared, that had it not been for that "one white squaw," they should have effected their purpose.</td>

"Died at Billerica, on the 4th inst., in the 71st year of his age, <span class="smcap">Edward Farmer</span>, Esq., who many years represented that town in the General Court. He ever combatted the enemies to the Laws and Constitution of his Country, both foreign and domestic. He was a firm patriot in our Revolutionary war, and commanded a party of militia at the capture of Burgoyne, and cheerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>ly obeyed the call of Government, in the insurrection of 1786. On the 6th his body was carried to the meeting-house, preceded by a volunteer company completely uniformed, and followed by a long train of the citizens of Billerica and the towns adjacent. Appropriate hymns were sung, a suitable lesson was read from the scriptures, and after a well adapted prayer by the Rev. Dr. Cumings, his remains, as attended above, were escorted to the mansions of the dead, and deposited with his fathers, with military honors. He left a numerous family to bemoan his loss."</td>

<p><em>Extracts of Letters from</em> Rev. Thomas Farmer, <em>Rector of Aspley-Guise,
in Bedfordshire, England</em>, <em>to</em> John Farmer <em>of Concord, N.&nbsp;H.</em> Dated
July, 1822.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Having lately been to visit my relations at Leicester,
my native place, I saw for the first time a letter from you, desiring an
account of your Genealogy; and, being satisfied of our consanguinity,
you will allow me to hope that you may cross the Atlantic, and visit
this village, of which I am the Rector, and which is situated but little
more than 40 miles from London, and near the Duke of Bedford's
magnificent Park and Palace.</p>

<p>I am possessed of the papers which formerly belonged to my uncle,
Dr. Richard Farmer, who certainly was a most ingenious and classical
scholar, and perhaps the best annotator on England's immortal bard.
You may know that he was Master of Emmanuel College in the
University of Cambridge. There I was educated, and there I saw
him die, after a very long protracted illness, on the 8th of September,
1797. The loose papers, from which I shall send you extracts, are
in Dr. Farmer's hand-writing.</p>

<p>My father, Thomas Farmer, is now at Leicester, and is the only
male issue of his generation. He was born on the 10th of May, 1744.
I was born on the 21st of August, 1771, and am the only issue left,
and I am in possession of land in the vicinity of Nuneaton, sharing it
equally with Mr. Arnold of Ashley, no great distance from Daventry,
in the County of Northampton.</p>

<p>Of the present owner of Ancely, or Astly, I know nothing; but in
the old papers, I find John Farmer of Ancely, in the County of Warwick,
passes a time, Sept. 1st, 1604, and that a John Farmer, in 1663,
[1633?] contracts marriage with Isabel Barbage of Great Packington,
in the County of Warwick, and that Isabel, in after marriage articles, is
stiled "<em>now of New England</em>;" that John Farmer of Nuneaton married
Sarah Daws of Tamworth, and settles the estate at Ancely upon her.
Richard F., son of John and Sarah, was baptized at Nuneaton,
Sept. 15, 1698, and married Hannah Knibb of Brinklow, in the County of
Warwick, Jan. 4, 1732-3. Their eldest son, Richard, born May 4, 1735,
was the person whom you have rightly named of such extensive
literary fame and acquirements.</p>

<p>I shall seal this with the seal<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> which Dr. Farmer wore and used,
and the Arms I read, "He beareth Sable, Chevron between three
Lamps Argent, with Fire Proper, by the name of Farmer." This
coat was assigned to George Farmer, Esq., 1663, second son of
Bartholomew Farmer, Gent.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of Radcliffe, near Atherstone, Warwickshire.
The patent was to <em>alter</em> the Chevron of the family, though it
mentions not what anciently were the Arms of the family.</p>

<p><cite>From the same to the same, dated Aspley-Guise, Dec. 1, 1823.</cite></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;The family of Farmers from which we are descended, were
living about the year of our Lord, 1500, at a village called Ratcliffe-Cuiley,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>which is in Leicestershire, and adjoining the Counties of
Warwick and Stafford. One of them was a Judge in the Court of
Common Pleas, and you observe by the scrap enclosed, another of
them, Chancellor of the Cathedral Church of Salisbury, which scrap
is the hand-writing of the author on the learning of Shakspeare. Most
of them are buried in a vault belonging to the family, in the church of
Witherly, (near Ratcliffe) in the County of Leicester. My grandfather's
name was <em>Richard</em>, who married a Miss Knibb, and their family
consisted of Richard, [b. May 4, 1735,] the annotator on our immortal
bard, Prebendary of Canterbury, then a Canon Residentiary of St.
Paul's, London, the Master of Emmanuel College in Cambridge, and
principal Librarian of that University; <em>John</em>, in holy Orders; <em>Thomas</em>,
my father, [b. May 10, 1744,] who married the 3rd dau. of John
Andrew, Esq., of Harlestone-Park in the County of Northampton;
<em>Joseph</em>, Lieut. Col. of the Royal Leicester volunteers; <em>Hannah</em>, unmarried;
<em>Sarah</em> married Allen Brown, Esq., of Cosby, near Leicester, and
afterwards Richard Jervis, a surgeon of Latterworth; <em>Mary</em> married
[in 1768,] the Hon. Richard Byron, [b. Oct. 28, 1724,] brother of the late
Lord [William] Byron.</p>

<h2>MEMOIRS OF GRADUATES OF HARVARD COLLEGE.</h2>

<p class="center">Commencing with the year 1670.</p>

<p class="center">BY THE LATE JOHN FARMER, ESQ.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Note.</span> The year they were graduated is prefixed to the name of each person, in the several
Memoirs.
</p>


<h3>NATHANIEL HIGGINSON.</h3>

<p>1670. <span class="smcap">Nathaniel Higginson</span>, son of Rev. John Higginson,
pastor of the first church in Salem, was born at Guilford, Ct.,
Oct. 11, 1652. After receiving his second degree in 1673, he
made preparation to go to England, where an uncle of his had
been settled as a clergyman, and where he had a number of relations.
He went thither the following year, and was soon introduced
to Lord Wharton, with whom he remained about seven
years, in the capacity of steward and tutor to his children. He was
employed in the mint of the Tower in 1681, and went in 1683 in
the East India Company's service to Fort St. George in the East
Indies; was a member and secretary of the council, and afterwards
governor of the factory at said fort. He married Elizabeth
Richards, 1692; returned to England with his wife and four children
in 1700, and established himself as a merchant in London,
and did considerable business with his New England friends.</p>

<p>In 1706, we find his name, with 19 others, signed to a petition
full of invective against Joseph Dudley, then Governor of Massachusetts,
and praying for his removal, which was presented and
read to Queen Anne in council. Gov. Dudley, in his answer to
the charges contained in this petition, notices several of the peti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>tioners,
and thus speaks of Mr. H. "Mr. Higginson is a gentleman
of good value, born in New England, but has been absent in the
East Indies six and twenty years, and so may be presumed to
know nothing of the country. To be sure, his father, that has been
a minister in the country near sixty years, yet living, and his
brother, a member of her Majesty's Council, must know more, his
brother having been always assisting the Governor, and consenting
in Col. Dudley's justification at this time with the Council, where
no man has dissented from the vote sent herewith." The allegations
against Gov. Dudley in this petition, were voted by the General
Court, or Council and House, to be a "wicked and scandalous
accusation;" but some persons of note, considering the high character
of Mr. Higginson and his good interest at court, "signified by
their letters, that they thought the two Houses impolitic in the
severity of their expressions, which, from being their friend, might,
at least, cause him to become cool and indifferent." We know not
the effect of the language of the General Court on the mind of Mr.
Higginson, but we cannot suppose it alienated his affections from
his native country. He lived but two years after, to serve the
interests of his friends in New England. He died in London of
the small pox, in November, 1708, aged 56 years. He had been for
several years a member of the Corporation for Propagating the
Gospel among the Indians of New England. Judge Sewall says,
he had been acquainted with him for forty years, and seems to
have had a high opinion of his character and public services. <cite>Felt,

Dudley's MS. Answer to Mr. H.'s petition</cite> (the <em>original</em>, which
escaped, in part, the fury of the mob, when they destroyed Gov.
Hutchinson's house.)</p>


<h3>AMMI RUHAMAH CORLET.</h3>

<p>1670. <span class="smcap">Ammi Ruhamah Corlet</span> was son of the celebrated
schoolmaster, Elijah Corlet, of whom an early poet sang,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis Corlet's pains, and Cheever's, we must own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou, New England, art not Scythia grown."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The father was educated at Lincoln College in the University of
Oxford, and the son had all the advantages of early preparation,
which could be derived from so distinguished a scholar. Having
been graduated, he appears to have followed the business of his
father, and in 1672 we find him at Plymouth, as the Master of the
principal school in that place. After taking his second degree, or
about that time, he was a Fellow of the College, in which office, it
is presumed, he continued till his death, which occurred Feb. 1,
1679.</p>


<h3>THOMAS CLARK.</h3>

<p>1670. <span class="smcap">Thomas Clark</span>, son of Jonas Clarke, of Cambridge, a
surveyor of some note, was born, March 2, 1653. Rev. Mr. Allen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
in his History of Chelmsford, says in relation to Mr. Clark, "We
have neither church records, manuscript sermons, cotemporary
notices, nor any other materials, from which a bare memento can be
erected, excepting the following sentence in the 9th volume of the
Hist. Coll. of Mass., page 195. 'Dorchester, 1704, Dec. 10. The
death of Rev. Thomas Clark of Chelmsford was lamented in a sermon
from Acts xx: 25, &amp;c.' A great loss to all our towns, and
especially to our frontier towns on that side of the country, who
are greatly weakened with the loss of such a man." Besides the
above extract from Mr. Allen, we find a fact in Dr. Cotton Mather's
"Wonders of the Invisible World," which is creditable to the character
of Mr. Clark. In the time of the witchcraft delusion, "there
was at Chelmsford an afflicted person, that in her fits cried out
against a woman, a neighbor, which Mr. Clark, the minister of the
gospel there, could not believe to be guilty of such a crime, [witchcraft.]
And it happened while that woman milked her cow, the
cow struck her with one horn upon the forehead and fetched blood.
And while she was bleeding, a spectre of her likeness appeared to
the party afflicted, who pointing at the spectre, one struck at the
place, and the afflicted said, <em>You have made her forehead bleed!</em>
Hereupon some went to the woman and found her forehead bloody,
and acquainted Mr. Clark with it, who forthwith went to the woman
and asked her, <em>How her forehead became bloody?</em> and she answered,
<em>By a blow of the cow's horn</em>, as abovesaid; whereby he was satisfied
that it was a design of Satan to render an innocent person suspected."
The conduct of Mr. Clark in this decision, made at the
time when the spectral evidence was so generally received, probably
prevented the infatuation from extending to Chelmsford. Happy
would it have been had all ministers and magistrates exercised a
like discrimination in rejecting all evidence against persons whose
characters had been previously good. By the magistrates at Salem,
the coincidence of the imaginary wound inflicted on the spectre,
and the real wound from the cow's horn on the woman, would
have been sufficient for the condemnation of the latter.</p>

<p>Mr. Clark was the minister of Chelmsford twenty-seven years,
having been ordained, in 1677, as the successor of Rev. John Fiske.
His labors were suddenly terminated, being seized, according to
Judge Sewall's Diary, with a fever, on Friday the 2nd, which caused
his death on the following Wednesday, December 7, 1704, in the
52nd year of his age.</p>

<p>Mr. Clark was twice married. The name of his first wife was
Mary, who died Dec. 2, 1700. His second was Elizabeth, daughter
of Rev. Samuel Whiting, whom he married, Oct. 2, 1702. His
children, who lived to mature years, all by his first wife, were Lucy,
who married Major John Tyng, father of Judge John Tyng, Sept.
19, 1700. She died April 25, 1708; Elizabeth, who married John
Hancock of West Cambridge; Jonas, born Dec. 2, 1684, who resided
on the farm, known by the name of the Cragie farm. There he
kept a public house and ferry which have ever since borne his name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
His house was the general resort for all fashionable people. He was
honored with many civil and military offices; was a very popular
man, and esteemed as a good Christian. He died April 8, 1770,
aged 86. Thomas, the youngest son, was born Sept. 28, 1694.</p>


<h3>GEORGE BURROUGH.</h3>

<p>1670. <span class="smcap">George Burrough</span>, or as the name is usually spelt,
Burroughs, was, perhaps, a son of Jeremiah Burroughs, an
inhabitant of Scituate, Ms., as early as 1647; but we have no
certain information of his parentage or the time of his birth.
He was admitted a member of the church in Roxbury, April 12,
1674, and his son George was baptized in the church there, Nov.
28, 1675. He became a preacher within a few years after he left
College, and, as early as 1675 or 1676, he was the minister at Casco,
in Maine, and was there when that town suffered the loss of so
many lives by an attack of the Indians. The war which soon
followed, drove Mr. Burroughs from Maine, and he returned to
Massachusetts. In November, 1680, he was employed to preach at
Salem Village, now Salem. He continued there probably until
1683, when, in May, Mr. Lawson was invited to preach to the
people. Mr. Burroughs returned to his ministry in Casco the same
year. A work entitled "European Settlements in America," in
speaking of Mr. Burroughs as a victim of the Salem Witchcraft,
says, "that he was a gentleman who had formerly been minister of
Salem; but upon some of the religious disputes which divided the
country he differed from his flock, and left them." Mather, in his
"Wonders of the Invisible World," countenances this idea, saying
"he had removed from Salem Village in ill terms some years
before." Mr. Willis, in his History of Portland, says, "The first
notice of his return to Casco is in June, 1683, when, at the request
of the town, he relinquished 150 acres of land, which had been
granted to him previous to the war. In their application to him
for this purpose, they offered to give him 100 acres 'further off,' for
the quantity relinquished, but Burroughs replied, 'as for the land
already taken away, we were welcome to it, and, if 20 acres of the
50 above expressed would pleasure us, he freely gave it to us, not
desiring any land anywhere else, nor any thing else in consideration
thereof.'"</p>

<p>His disinterestedness places the character of Mr. Burroughs in an
amiable light, which nothing can be found, during the whole
course of his ministry at Casco, to impair. The large quantity of
land which he relinquished was situated upon the Neck, which was
then daily becoming more valuable, by the location of the town
upon it. All this, excepting thirty acres, he freely returned, without
accepting the consideration offered by the town.</p>

<p>The unhappy catastrophe which terminated the life and usefulness
of Mr. Burroughs, has cast a shade upon many facts relating to
him which would be interesting to us to know. We have no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of ascertaining whether he was regularly settled and had gathered
a church at Casco or not. There is, however, sufficient authority for
asserting, that he preached to the people there a longer period than
any Congregational minister prior to Rev. Thomas Smith.</p>

<p>"There has nothing," says Mr. Willis, "survived Mr. Burroughs,
either in his living or dying, that casts any reproach upon his character;
and, although he died a victim of a fanaticism, as wicked and
stupid as any which has been countenanced in civilized society,
and which for a time prejudiced his memory, yet his character
stands redeemed in a more enlightened age from any blemish."</p>

<p>Mr. Burroughs was driven from Casco by the Indians in 1690,
and went to Wells, where he resided when he was accused of the
crime of witchcraft. The indictment against him is given in the
second volume of Hutchinson. He was examined on May 8,
1692, and committed to prison in Boston until his trial, which took
place in August following. He was condemned on testimony,
which nothing but the most highly wrought infatuation could for a
moment have endured. His great strength and activity, for which
he had been remarkable from his youth, were enlisted against him,
as having been derived from the Prince of evil. It was in evidence,
that he had lifted a barrel of molasses by putting his finger in the
bunghole, and carried it round him; that he held a gun more than
seven feet long at arm's length with one hand, and performed other
surprising feats above the power of humanity. Some evidence
was also exhibited against his moral character, in relation to his treatment
of his wives and children, but we can attach but very little
credit to it considering the great perversion of truth at that time.</p>

<p>He was executed August 19, 1692, on Gallows hill, in Salem.
At his execution, he made a most solemn, pertinent, and affecting
prayer, which drew the remark from Cotton Mather, who was
present, as I was informed by the late Dr. Bentley, "that no man
could have made such a prayer unless the devil helped him." He
concluded his dying petition with the Lord's prayer, probably to
convince some of the spectators of his innocence; for it was the
received opinion, that a true witch or wizard could not say the
Lord's prayer without blundering.</p>

<p>The age of Mr. Burroughs is represented by Dr. Bentley, in his
Hist. of Salem, published in 1 Coll. Mass. Hist. Soc. vi., to have
been <em>about fourscore years</em>; but that writer undoubtedly transferred
the age of Giles Cory, who wanted only three years of being
<em>fourscore</em>, to Mr. Burroughs. It can by no means be admitted, that
Mr. B. was nearly 60 years old when he graduated, which must
have been the case if he was 80 years old at the time he was
executed.</p>

<p>Mr. Burroughs had been three times married. The names of
his first and second wives are not known. His last was daughter
of Thomas Ruck, and she survived him. His children were
George, baptized 1675, who lived in Ipswich; Jeremiah, who was
insane; Rebecca, who married a Tolman of Boston; Hannah, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
married a Fox, and lived near Barton's Point in Boston; Elizabeth,
who married Peter Thomas of Boston, the ancestor of the late
Isaiah Thomas, LL. D., of Worcester. George and Thomas
Burroughs of Newburyport, the former a tanner, conveyed to N.
Winslow, in 1774, the right of George Burroughs in proprietary
land in Falmouth. These were probably descendants of the
minister.&mdash;<cite>Hutchinson, Hist. Mass.</cite> ii. 57-59. <cite>Felt, Annals of
Salem.</cite> <cite>Neal's Hist. N. E.</cite> ii. 130-134, 144. <cite>Willis, Hist. Portland
in Coll. Maine Hist. Soc.</cite> i. 144, 174-176. <cite>Upham, Lectures
on Witchcraft.</cite> <cite>Allen, Biog. Dict. art. Burroughs.</cite></p>


<h3>ISAAC FOSTER.</h3>

<p>1671. <span class="smcap">Isaac Foster</span>, according to the late William Winthrop,
Esq., was from Charlestown, and might have been brother of John
Foster, who was graduated in 1667; but this is uncertain, as the
latter was from Dorchester. [We find him to have been admitted
freeman in 1679, about which time, he probably went to Connecticut.]
Mr. Winthrop may have considered him as belonging to
Charlestown from the circumstance of his being called to preach
there. When a committee of the town of Charlestown was about
selecting a successor to Rev. Thomas Shepard, in 1678, the opinions
of Rev. John Sherman, Rev. Increase Mather, and Rev. President
Oakes were requested as to the "fittest person" for their minister,
and these gentlemen recommended Mr. Foster as "the fittest and
suitablest person" for that place. While remaining at Charlestown
he was admitted freeman, in 1679. Soon after this, he went
to Connecticut and preached in Hartford, and, from his name being
printed in italics, it has been inferred that he was settled there, but
this does not clearly appear from Dr. Trumbull.</p>


<h3>SAMUEL PHIPPS.</h3>

<p>1671. <span class="smcap">Samuel Phipps</span>, son, it is presumed, of Solomon Phipps of
Charlestown, who died in that town, July 25, 1671, was born about
the year 1649. The most of his life was passed in civil offices,
having been Register of Deeds for the county of Middlesex, Clerk of
the Court of Common Pleas for the same county, and representative
for the town of Charlestown, where he resided. To the last office
he was elected in 1692, being one of the first representatives under
the charter of William and Mary. In 1700, he was one of the
Commissioners of claims for receiving and examining all titles and
claims to land in the eastern province of Maine. Mr. Phipps
died in August, 1725, aged 76, and was buried in the tomb of his
son-in-law Lemmon. His wife was Mary Danforth, daughter of
Dep. Gov. Thomas Danforth. She was born July 28, 1650. [We
find the name of Danforth associated with Phipps in the class of
1781.] Thomas Phipps, who graduated in 1695, was his son.</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Brentwood.</span> In Dec. 12, 1748, according to Farmer's Statistics of New
Hampshire ministers, <em>Rev. Nathaniel Trask</em> was settled in this place.</p>

<p>"Jan. 18, 1756, this church [Hampton church] was sent for to install the
Rev. Mr. Trask at Brentwood. They chose Deacons Tuck and Lane, who
went. And the affair was completed with love and peace, decency and good
order. Mr. Odlin and Flagg prayed. I preached, Col. iv: 17. Mr. Whipple
gave the charge. Attest, W. Cotton, Pastor."</p>

<p>Over a church newly organized, Mr. Trask was installed, as stated in the
records of Rev. W. Cotton, Jan. 21, 1756.</p>

<p>Mr. Trask retained the pastoral office in Brentwood, 41 years; though he
ceased from his pulpit labors, about two years before his death, which occurred
Dec. 12, 1789, at the age of 67. He married Parnel Thing, June 15, 1749.
Their children were Elizabeth, born July 30, 1750, died in Brentwood,
Parnel, born July 2, 1752, died Sept. 8, 1756. Nathaniel, born Sept. 8. 1754,
died Sept. 5, 1756; Mary, born Sept. 14, 1756. Parnel, born Aug. 27, 1759,
died July 21, 1762. Samuel, born Sept. 10, 1762, settled and died in Brentwood,
where his son and daughter now live. Jonathan, born Dec. 12, 1764,
settled in Mount Vernon, Me.</p>

<p>From the decease of Mr. Trask, the church was without a pastor eleven years
and a half. During that period, <em>more than a hundred individuals</em> were employed
as candidates for settlement, or as supplies. Eight or ten, successively, received
and declined invitations to settle.</p>

<p>At the ordination of the <em>Rev. Ebenezer Flint</em>, the church had become reduced
to six male and thirteen female members. Mr. Flint died suddenly, Oct. 12,
1811, aged 42, leaving a widow, who died at the age of 72 years.</p>

<p>He studied theology with the Rev. Dr. Emmons. He married Mary, daughter
of Deacon Kendall of Tewksbury, Ms. Two of his children were Mary K.,
who married Ebenezer Orne, and Abigail J., who married Jonathan Robinson,
3rd. The youngest son of Mr. Flint, Ezra M., married Louisa P. Haynes of
Charlestown, Ms., and now lives there. The eldest, Ebenezer, resides in
Brentwood, unmarried.</p>

<p>From the time of Mr. Flint's death, the church was destitute of a pastor more
than four years.</p>

<p><em>Rev. Chester Colton</em> preached at Brentwood, July 21, 1813. He proved to be
the Barnabas they needed; and the friends of religious order, being encouraged
and strengthened, settled him. Rev. Mr. Rowland of Exeter preached the
ordination sermon, from 1 Cor. i: 21, and Rev. Dr. Pearson of Andover, Ms., gave
the charge.</p>

<p>The people became ardently attached to Mr. Colton, and his labors were
blessed. He was dismissed at his own urgent request, on account of an inflammation
of his eyes which forbade application to study. Mr. Colton's vision
was, in a few years, so far restored, by rest and medical treatment, that he
resumed the labors of a pastor, and was installed at Lyme, Ct., Feb. 12, 1829.
Recently he has labored under the direction of the Connecticut Missionary Society,
in North Goshen, Ct.</p>

<p><em>Rev. Luke Ainsworth Spofford</em> was installed in Brentwood, and, after laboring
about three years, and not finding his hopes of usefulness realized, he requested
and received a dismission. The number of church members reported, June,
1828, was 53. Subsequently to his ministry at Brentwood, Mr. Spofford was
installed at Lancaster, N.&nbsp;H., 1829; Atkinson, N.&nbsp;H., 1832; Scituate, Ms., 1835;
Chilmark, on Martha's Vineyard, Ms., 1842; from which place he removed to
Newburg, N. Y., where his family resides. Mr. Spofford, before he came to
Brentwood, had been ordained at Gilmanton, N.&nbsp;H., where he enjoyed a successful
ministry of six years; but, on account of the state of his health, and the
extent of the field, resigned June 9, 1825. For more particular notices, see
Rev. Mr. Lancaster's History of Gilmanton, and Notes respecting the ministers
in Gilmanton, in the first number of the New Hampshire Repository, Vol. I.</p>

<p>After Mr. Spofford's resignation, the people in Brentwood enjoyed the labors
of <em>Rev. Jonathan Ward</em> about three and a half years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Ward studied theology with Rev. Dr. Emmons, and was ordained in
New Milford, now Alna, Me., in 1796, and resigned in 1818. Although Mr.
Ward has never been installed in New Hampshire, he has, in many respects,
performed the services of a pastor to some of the churches in a very acceptable
and useful manner. Mr. Ward labored twelve years, most of the time statedly,
in Plymouth, his native place, and the place of his father's ministry, for more
than thirty-two years.</p>

<p>Mr. Ward's father, Rev. Nathan Ward, was born at Newton, Ms., April 11,
1721, died June 15, 1804, aged 83. He married Tamasin Ireland, who was
born Jan. 1, 1722, O. S., and died Aug. 16, 1777. Rev. Nathan Ward, who
was hopefully converted under the preaching of Mr. Whitefield, had not a collegiate
education, but received an honorary degree of M. A. from Dartmouth
College. His children, beside Jonathan the youngest, were Nathan, born Jan.
9, 1748, O. S., died Nov. 3, 1776; Enoch, born July 4, 1749, died July
31, 1825; Abraham, born Feb. 9, 1751, died Dec. 6, 1776; Mary, born
Sept. 18, 1752, died Dec. 6, 1776; Abigail, born March 31, 1755, N. S.,
died Sept. 16, 1841; Samuel, born Aug. 26, 1756, died Nov. 8, 1776;
Isaac, born March 16, 1758, died Feb. 27, 1816; Benjamin, born Sept. 21,
1761, died &mdash;&mdash;; Daniel, born Jan. 30, 1764; Esther, born Aug. 17, 1767,
died Dec. 8, 1776. The submission of the parents was painfully tested, by
the death of five of their children, with a putrid fever, within five weeks.
Enoch, brother of Rev. N. Ward, entered the ministry, but died young. He
graduated at Harvard University, 1736. The grandfather of Rev. J. Ward
was Joseph, whose father was John, who settled in Newton, Ms., and one of a
large family, brought by their father, William Ward, from England, about 1646,
who settled in Sudbury, Ms. Rev. Jonathan Ward married Philenia Gay
Whitaker of Attleborough, Ms., who was born April 6, 1776, and died April
25, 1825. Their children were Jonathan, born Nov. 30, 1800, graduated at D.&nbsp;C.,
1822, studied at the Theological Seminary, Andover, ordained at Biddeford,
Me., Oct. 26, 1825, died Feb. 8, 1826, aged 25; James Wilson, born May 21,
1803, graduated at D.&nbsp;C., 1826, studied at the Theological Seminary, Andover,
and at New Haven, ordained at Abington, Ms., May 31, 1834; Philenia, born
Oct. 16, 1804, married Frederick Robinson of Brentwood; Laura Elizabeth,
born May 7, 1807, married Lucius M. Perdy of Sharon, Ct.</p>

<p><em>Rev. Francis Welch</em> was the fourth settled minister in Brentwood. He has
labored since he left that place in Ipswich, Linebrook Parish, Ms.; and in
Perry, Washington County, Me.</p>

<p><em>Rev. John Gunnison</em>, who had been previously ordained at Lyman, Me., May
12, 1831, installed over the Union Society of Salisbury and Amesbury, Ms.,
Dec 31, 1835, and at Newmarket, Lamprey River, Feb. 22, 1837, was
installed at Brentwood. He was, after leaving Brentwood, installed at West
Falmouth, Me., in Jan., 1842. He now resides at Portland, but at present
supplies the pulpit of the first church in Westbrook. He studied theology
with the Rev. Charles Jenkins of Portland, Me., and entered the ministry late
in life. He married for his first wife, Joanna Dow of Gilmanton, and for his
second, a woman by the name of Starboard.</p>

<p><em>Rev. James Boutwell</em>, who was born May 14, 1814, graduated at the Theological
Seminary, Andover, in 1840. He was an Instructor at Dunkirk, N. Y., one
year. Mr. Boutwell has seven brothers and one sister older, and two sisters
younger, than himself. His paternal grandfather was of Wilmington, Ms. His
maternal grandfather was Dr. Benjamin Jones, of Lyndeborough, a physician of
some celebrity, whose native place was Ipswich, Ms. Mr. Boutwell's brother,
William Thurston Boutwell, was several years a missionary among the
Ojibwa Indians, in Wisconsin. Mr. Boutwell married Mary P., daughter of
Dea. Pascal Abbot of Andover, Ms., April 10, 1837. Their children are Mary
Lucelia, born at Dunkirk, N. Y., March 8, 1838; James Pascal, born at Andover,
Feb. 6, 1840, died Oct. 31, 1844; George Clark, born at Brentwood, Feb.
8, 1842; Charles Hawley, born at Brentwood, Oct. 29, 1843; Hannah Elizabeth,
born March 11, 1846.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deerfield</span> was a part of Nottingham, from which it was separated, and incorporated
Jan. 8, 1766. The Congregational Society was formed in Dec., 1772.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Rev. Timothy Upham</em> was the first minister. His first wife, who was the
mother of all his children, was Hannah, daughter of Rev. Nathaniel Gookin of
Northampton. Her twin sister, Elizabeth, married Dr. Edmund Chadwick
of Deerfield, father of Peter Chadwick, Esq., of Exeter. The children of Rev.
Mr. Upham are Hon. Nathaniel Upham of Rochester; Gen. Timothy Upham
of Portsmouth; and Miss Hannah Upham, the celebrated Principal of the
Female Institute in Canandaigua, N. Y. Among the grandchildren of Rev.
Mr. Upham, are Rev. Thomas Cogswell Upham, D. D., Professor in Bowdoin
College, who was previously pastor of the Congregational church in Rochester;
Hon. Nathaniel Gookin Upham, a Judge of the Superior Court of N.&nbsp;H.; Mary,
widow of Hon. David Barker, Jr., and now wife of Ebenezer Coe, Esq.; Alfred,
M. D., of New York; Timothy, M. D., deceased; Joseph Badger Upham, Merchant
in Portsmouth; Judith Almira, married to James Bell, Esq.; Hannah
Elizabeth, deceased; Ruth Cogswell, married to John Berry, M. D.; Francis
William, a member of the Boston Bar; and Albert Gookin, M. D., of Boston.</p>

<p>The New England genealogy of the Rev. Timothy Upham is traced to John
Upham, born in England, in 1597, who emigrated to Weymouth, New England,
in 1635, and went thence to Malden. He was highly esteemed for his piety,
intelligence, and energy of character; filled various civil offices, and was deacon
of the church many years. He performed the duties of moderator of a town
meeting a few months before his death, which took place Feb. 25, 1681, at the
age of 84.</p>

<p>Lieut. Phinehas Upham, son of John Upham, married Ruth Wood. He died
in consequence of wounds received in the capture of Narraganset Fort, in 1675.
Phinehas, son of Lieut. Phinehas, married Mary Mellins. His son Phinehas
married Tamzen Hill, whose son Timothy married Mary Cheever. These last
were the parents of Rev. Timothy Upham, whose New England ancestors, from
the first, were men of influence in the church, and in the community, and were
distinguished for intelligence, firmness of character, and a spirit of enterprise.
The first wife of Rev. Timothy Upham died Aug. 4, 1797, aged 44. Mr. Upham
died in the 63rd year of his age, and 39th of his ministry. The sermon at
his funeral, from Heb. xiii: 8, by Rev. Peter Holt, ascribes to Mr. Upham
"many gifts and excellent qualifications for a gospel minister." Mr. Upham's
second wife, who was Miss Hephzibah Neal of Stratham, died May 11, 1811.
See <cite>Family History, by Albert G. Upham, A. M., M. D.</cite>, 1845.</p>

<p><em>Rev. Nathaniel Wells</em> was engaged sixteen years in mercantile business before
entering the ministry. He studied theology with Rev. Moses Hemmenway,
D. D., of Wells, Me., whose daughter he married in 1797. After a diligent and
useful ministry of about 30 years, he resigned his pastoral charge. Two of his
sons are settled in the ministry. Theodore, ordained in Barrington, June 12,
1845; Moses Hemmenway, ordained in Pittsfield, Nov. 19, 1845. Rev.
Nathaniel Wells was son of Dea. Nathaniel Wells, whose father was also Dea.
Nathaniel Wells, who removed to Wells, Me., from Ipswich, Ms., and who was
a son of Dea. Thomas Wells of Ipswich, who died in that place, Oct. 26, 1666.</p>

<p><em>Rev. Ephraim Nelson Hidden</em> was Preceptor of Gilmanton Academy, three
years; graduated at Gilmanton Theological Seminary, 1840; was married, Aug.
28, 1840, to Mary Elizabeth Parsons, daughter of Josiah Parsons, Esq., of
Gilmanton, whose wife was Judith Badger, great-granddaughter of Gen. Joseph
Badger, Senior. He was son of Ephraim Hidden, and nephew of Rev.
Samuel Hidden of Tamworth, N.&nbsp;H., and grandson of Price Hidden of Rowley,
Ms. His first New England ancestor emigrated from England and settled in
Rowley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Epping.</span> <em>Rev. Robert Cutler</em> was the first minister. In 1755, Mr. Cutler,
being charged with immoral conduct, was dismissed by a Council. He was
installed in Greenwich, Ms., Feb. 13, 1760, where he died, Feb. 24, 1786, aged
probably 68.</p>

<p><em>Rev. Josiah Stearns</em> closed his ministry and life, July 25, 1788. He
descended from Isaac Stearns, who came from England, with Gov. Winthrop,
in 1630, and settled in Watertown. The line of descent is 1. Isaac and Sarah
Stearns. 2. John Stearns, who married Sarah Mixer of Watertown. He
settled in Billerica. 3. John Stearns, who married Elizabeth &mdash;&mdash;. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the first child born in Billerica, on record. 4. John Stearns, who married Esther
Johnson. She was a <em>great-granddaughter</em> of the celebrated Capt. Edward
Johnson, author of the History of New England, entitled "Wonder-working
Providence of Sion's Saviour in New England." In several publications, she
is incorrectly mentioned as the <em>daughter</em> of the historian. Her father was a
second Capt. Edward Johnson, her grandfather was William Johnson, Esq.
John and Esther Stearns were the parents of Rev. Josiah Stearns of Epping.
The following short obituary notice appeared in a public print, Aug. 27, 1788.
It is attributed to the pen of the Rev. Dr. Tappan, then of Newbury, afterwards
Professor of Divinity in Harvard University.</p>

<p>"For the Essex Journal and New Hampshire Packet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hoyt,&mdash;The Rev. Mr. Stearns, whose death was announced in your
last, sustained a character too great and too good to be passed over in silence.
The God of Nature endued him with singular abilities, which, by the aid of
erudition, fitted him for extensive usefulness. His assiduous application to the
work of the ministry was truly worthy of imitation. In him shone an assemblage
of virtues and graces which rarely meet in the same person. He had a
lively fancy, a penetrating judgment, a correct taste, and a mind expanded as
the heavens. His conversation was ever seasonable, grave, pathetic, and instructive.
His public discourses were replete with good sense, with important truths
in a clear and instructive light, and received the approbation of the best judges.
He despised pageantry, without the appearance of affectation. He trusted to
nothing mortal; pitied, but envied not, such as had their portion in this life.
His advice in Council was often sought, and ever approved. He had a constitutional
firmness, and was capable of the most dispassionate reasoning. He
repudiated errors ancient and modern, and rejoiced to the last in his faithful
adherence to the doctrines of grace. Elevated by the purer sentiments, he ever
possessed a mind calm and serene. God, who is all-wise in council, was pleased
to try his faith and patience in the furnace of affliction. After a lingering
and painful sickness, he died of a cancer, in the 57th year of his age. In him
died a friend to justice, liberty, and energetic government; a vigorous watchman,
a patient guide, an affectionate pastor, a prudent, kind husband, and an
indulgent but truly faithful parent."</p>

<p>Mr. Stearns was a close and thorough student. He studied the Scriptures
in their original languages, with unremitting diligence. His limited means would
not allow him to possess much of a library, but he was favored with the use of
books by friends, who were able to own them. He was accustomed to borrow
one volume at a time, and when he had read it through, its contents were his
own. The late Rev. Dr. Thayer of Kingston, mentioning this fact, added,
"The Bible especially was his Library." So intimate was his knowledge of
the Scriptures, that "he could readily cite chapter and verse, where almost any
text was to be found." Mr. Stearns was an ardent friend of liberty. "Some
of his sons were in the field, during a greater part of the Revolutionary contest;
and he sacrificed most of his worldly interest in support of the American cause."
[<cite>Alden's Epitaphs.</cite>] He was a member of a State Convention, in Exeter, in
which he regarded himself as fully committed to the risk of his personal
safety. Returning from the Convention, he called his children around him,
told them of the stand he had taken, and added, "If the cause shall prevail it
will be a great blessing to the country, but if it should fail, your poor old father's
head will soon be a button for a halter."</p>

<p>Mr. Stearns was tall in person, and interesting in his pulpit performances.
He held the untiring attention of his audience, which not unfrequently filled
the seats and aisles of his meeting-house, while, in pleasant weather, a number
stood abroad around the doors and windows.</p>

<p>Of the printed sermons of Mr. Stearns, two were on 1 John iv: 8,&mdash;"God is
love." These were preached in Exeter, and printed after his death, at the request,
made to him in his last sickness, of Hon. John Phillips, for the use of the
members of the Academy. Another was on early piety, with a brief memoir
of Samuel Lawrence, preached Sept. 19, 1779. Another was a Fast sermon.</p>

<p>Mr. Stearns married first, Sarah Abbot of Andover. They had three sons
and three daughters. One of the sons was John Stearns, Esq., of Deerfield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
N.&nbsp;H. Mrs. Stearns died in November, 1766. In September, 1767, he married
Sarah Ruggles, daughter of Rev. Samuel Ruggles of Billerica, who was a
grandson of Rev. John Woodbridge of Andover, and great-grandson of Gov.
Thomas Dudley. By the second marriage, also, Mr. Stearns had three sons
and three daughters.</p>

<p>Rev. Samuel Stearns, son of Rev. Josiah Stearns, by his second marriage,
was born in Epping, April 8, 1770; graduated at H. U. 1794; studied theology
with Rev. Jonathan French of Andover; and was ordained in Bedford, Ms.,
April 27, 1795, where he died, Dec. 26, 1834, aged 65. He married Abigail,
daughter of Rev. Mr. French of Andover. She was a descendant from John
Alden, one of the first Pilgrims, who is said by some to have been the first person,
who leaped upon the rock at Plymouth, New England, in 1620. Rev. Mr.
Stearns of Bedford lived to see three of his sons settled in the ministry. Rev.
Samuel Horatio Stearns, ordained over the Old South Church in Boston, Ms.,
April 16, 1834, died in Paris, France, July 15, 1837. His remains were brought
to his native country, and rest in Mount Auburn Cemetery. Rev. William
Augustus Stearns, ordained at Cambridgeport, Dec. 14, 1831, married
Rebecca Alden Frazer of Duxbury. Rev. Jonathan French Stearns was
ordained pastor of the first Presbyterian Church in Newburyport, Sept. 16,
1835. He married first, Joanna Chaplin, daughter of Dr. James Prescott Chaplin
of Cambridgeport. He married secondly, Anna S. Prentiss of Portland, Me.
Sarah Caroline, a daughter of Rev. Mr. Stearns of Bedford, married Rev. Forest
Jefferds, who was ordained at Epping, and afterwards installed at Middleton,
Ms. Charlotte Esther, a daughter of Rev. Samuel Stearns, married Rev.
Jonathan Leavitt. He was ordained at Bedford, and afterwards installed at
Providence, R. I. Rev. Josiah Howe Stearns, son of Dea. William Stearns and
grandson of Rev. Josiah Stearns of Epping, was ordained at Dennysville, Me.,
Nov. 6, 1844, and married Eliza Kilby, daughter of John Kilby, Esq., of that
place. The mother of Rev. Josiah Howe Stearns, who was, before marriage,
Abigail Richards Howe of Templeton, Ms., was a descendant of John Alden of
Pilgrim memory.</p>

<p><em>Rev. Peter Holt</em>, third pastor at Epping, was son of Joshua Holt, Esq., whose
brother, Rev. Nathan Holt, was pastor of the second Church in Danvers, Ms.
Rev. Peter Holt studied theology with Rev. Mr. French of Andover. He was
installed over the Presbyterian church in Peterborough, March 7, 1827;
resigned April, 1835; preached in Deering from 1835 to 1841. See notices of
Mr. Holt by Rev. Mr. Whiton, in the N.&nbsp;H. Repository, Vol. I. No. 3. Rev. Mr.
Holt of Epping married Hannah, daughter of Rev. Nathan Holt. They had
seven children. Two survive, Sarah and Mary; the first of these married Samuel
Endicott of Beverly. Nathan died at Epping, in his 12th year, of whom there
is an obituary in the Piscataqua Evan. Mag. Vol. IV. p. 36. The family of
Mr. Holt is traced to Nicholas Holt, who came from England to Newbury, in
1635, removed to Andover, and was one of the ten males who founded the
church there in 1645. [<cite>Coffin's History of Newbury</cite>; <cite>Abbot's History of Andover</cite>;
<cite>Farmer's Genealogical Register.</cite>]</p>

<p><em>Rev. Forest Jefferds</em>, who succeeded Mr. Holt, was son of Samuel, who was
the son of Samuel, who was the son of Rev. Samuel Jefferds of Wells, Me.,
whose father emigrated from England to Salem, Ms. Rev. Samuel Jefferds
was favored with a revival of religion in Wells, in 1741-2, and was one of the
attestors by letter to "the happy revival of religion in many parts of the land."
[<cite>Tracy's Hist. Great Awak.</cite>, p. 295.] Rev. Forest Jefferds received his classical
and theological education at the Theological Seminary, Bangor, graduated
1825, was installed at Middleton, Ms., May 2, 1832, resigned May 15, 1844.
Mr. Jefferds married Sarah Caroline, daughter of Rev. Samuel Stearns of
Bedford.</p>

<p><em>Rev. Calvin Chapman</em> was next ordained in Epping. A new house of worship
had been erected, which was dedicated in connection with the services of
his ordination. He graduated at Andover Theological Seminary, 1842, married
Lucy B. Emerson of Parsonsfield, Me. Mr. Chapman is now settled at Sacarappa,
Me.</p>

<p><em>Rev. Mr. Corser</em> was a son of David Corser of Boscawen, who was a son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
John, and grandson of John of Newbury, Ms., who emigrated to this country
from Scotland, about the year 1690. John, with David his son, removed from
Newbury to Boscawen, in the early settlement of the town, and purchased the
whole of that tract of land, which, from their name, is called Corser's Hill. Mr.
Corser studied divinity with Rev. Dr. Harris of Dunbarton, and was ordained
in Loudon, March 5, 1817. He was dismissed from his charge Sept. 20, 1838.
He preached as a supply at Northfield and Plymouth, till 1845. Since then he
has supplied at Epping, where he now resides. His son, Samuel B. G. Corser,
graduated at Dartmouth College, in 1841.</p>

<h2>FOREIGN MISSIONARIES FROM NORWICH, CT.</h2>


<p>The following is supposed to be a correct list of the Missionaries that have
gone out from Norwich. About twenty of them were natives, and the others
were for a considerable period residents of the town, before entering upon the
duties of the missionary. Two of them, it will be seen, belong to an earlier
period than the organization of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions. One is attached to a Methodist Mission; one is an Episcopal
clergyman in the employ of the Colonization Society, and twenty-four have
been in the service of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign
Missions.</p>

<h2>THE PASSENGERS OF THE MAY FLOWER IN 1620.</h2>

<p class="center">BY NATHANIEL BRADSTREET SHURTLEFF, M. D.</p>


<p>As early as the year 1602, several religious people residing near
the joining borders of Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, and Yorkshire,
together with their pious ministers, being grievously oppressed by
courts and canons, resolved to shake off the yoke of antichristian
bondage, and, as the Lord's free people, to form themselves by covenant
into a church-state, to walk in all his ways according to their
best knowledge and endeavors, cost them whatever it might.</p>

<p>In the year 1606, by reason of the distance of their habitations,
these people were obliged to assemble in two places and become two
distinct churches; over one of which Mr. John Smith was established
pastor, and among the others were Mr. Richard Clifton and Mr. John
Robinson, two very excellent and worthy preachers.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1607, Mr. Clifton and many of his church, being
extremely harassed, removed themselves and families to Holland,
where, in the spring of 1608, they were followed by Mr. Robinson and
the rest. They settled first at Amsterdam, where they remained a
year; but finding that Mr. Smith's church, which was there before
them, had fallen into contention with others, they, valuing peace and
spiritual comfort above other riches, removed with Mr. Robinson, their
pastor, to Leyden, Mr. Clifton remaining in Amsterdam, where he
soon died.</p>

<p>Soon after their arrival in Leyden, they chose Mr. William Brewster
to assist the pastor, as Elder of the Church. In their new place of
abode they lived in love and harmony with each other, and on friendly
terms of intercourse with their neighbors, till they removed to America.</p>

<p>By the year 1610, many had come over to them from various parts
of England, and they had increased and become a great congregation.</p>

<p>In 1617, Mr. Robinson and his church began to think of emigrating
to America; and, as a preparatory step, sent Mr. Robert Cushman and
Mr. John Carver from Leyden over to England, to treat with the Virginia
Company, and also to see if the King would grant them the liberty
of conscience there, which was refused them in the land of their
birth. Although the agents were not able to obtain from the King
their suit for liberty in religion under the broad seal, as was desired,
nevertheless, they prevailed so far as to gain the connivance of the
King that he would not molest them, provided they carried themselves
peaceably. In 1618, the agents returned to Leyden, to the great discouragement
of the people who sent them; who, notwithstanding, resolved,
in 1619, to send again two agents to agree with the Virginia
Company; and at this time they sent Mr. Cushman a second time,
and with him Mr. William Bradford, who, after long attendance,
obtained the patent granted by the Company to Mr. John Wincob,
which was never used.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all these troubles, so strong was their resolution to
quit Leyden and settle in America, that they entered into an arrangement
with Mr. Thomas Weston, a merchant of London, for their transportation,
and sent Mr. Carver and Mr. Cushman to England, to
receive the money of Mr. Weston, to assist in their transportation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
to provide for the voyage. By direction, Mr. Cushman went to London
and Mr. Carver to Southampton, where they finally joined with
Mr. William Martin, who had been chosen to assist them.</p>

<p>A vessel of sixty tons, called the Speedwell, was bought and fitted
in Holland, to be used in their transportation, and was designed to be
kept for use in their new country. Mr. Cushman, in June, 1620, also
hired at London the renowned May Flower, a vessel of ninescore tons,
and also Mr. Clarke, the pilot.</p>

<p>Mr. Cushman, having procured the May Flower at London, and
fitted it for the voyage, proceeded in it to Southampton, where he
and Captain Jones, together with the other agents, remained seven
days, until the arrival of the Pilgrims who left Leyden in July, embarking
from Delft Haven.</p>

<p>On the 5th of August, both vessels, the May Flower, Capt. Jones,
and the Speedwell, Capt. Reinolds, set sail from Southampton. The
small vessel proving leaky, they both put in to Dartmouth about
the 13th of August, where they remained till the 21st, when they set
sail again. Both vessels were obliged to return a second time on
account of the leakage of the Speedwell; and this time they put back
to Plymouth, where they gave up the small vessel and dismissed those
who were willing to return to London, Mr. Cushman and his family
returning with them.</p>

<p>On the 6th of September, their number then consisting of one
hundred persons, they made their final start, and arrived at Cape Cod
on the eleventh day of November, when they signed the famous compact,
and landed at Plymouth, in America, on the eleventh day of
December, Old Style, or on the <em>twenty-first</em> of December, <em>New Style</em>,
in the year 1620.</p>

<p>During their passage, one only died, William Butten, a young man,
servant to Mr. Samuel Fuller, the physician of the new colony, who
was included in Mr. Fuller's family, according to Governor Bradford,
although dead at the time of the signing of the compact.</p>

<p>One person was born during the passage, Oceanus Hopkins, a son of
Mr. Stephen Hopkins, who did not survive long after the landing.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the voyage, the number of passengers of
the May Flower was one hundred, and at the time of the arrival at
Cape Cod Harbor it was the same; one having died, and one having
been born, thus preserving the integrity of the number. Both of these
persons, however, are numbered among the passengers, and hence the
number is generally stated as one hundred and one.</p>

<p>Peregrine White, son of Mr. William White, was born in Cape Cod
Harbor, in November, after the signing of the compact and before the
landing, and is not included with the voyagers. He enjoyed the distinction
of being the first born white child in New England, of the
Leyden Pilgrims.</p>

<p>The first child born after the landing on the twenty-second day of
December, 1620, was a son of Mr. Isaac Allerton, but it did not survive
its birth.</p>

<p>The May Flower has already been stated to have been a vessel of
about ninescore tons, and was procured at London by Mr. Robert
Cushman, who was debarred the privilege of coming over with the
infant colonists, as it was necessary that he should remain in England,
to keep together those who were left behind, and to provide for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
future emigration, as he had done for that of those of the first passage.
This he did by procuring the Fortune, and sailing from London in
July, 1621, and arriving in New England on the 9th of November of
the same year. It is also highly probable that he obtained the other
early vessels, as he continued to be the agent of the Pilgrims till his
death, which occurred in England, just as he was ready to come to
spend the rest of his days in New England. In 1624, when the first
division of land for continuance took place, Mr. Cushman, although in
England, was placed at the head of the list of those who came in the
May Flower; an act of justice alike creditable to our forefathers and
honorable to him.</p>

<p>The May Flower not only brought over the first of the Leyden
Pilgrims, but also, in the year 1629, with four other vessels, transported
Mr. Higginson and his company to Salem; and in 1630, was one of
the fleet which conveyed to New England Mr. Winthrop and the
early settlers of the Massachusetts Colony.</p>

<p>A vessel bearing this name was owned in England about fifteen
years or more before the voyage of our forefathers; but it would be
impossible to prove or disprove its identity with the renowned May
Flower, however great such a probability might be. It is known,
nevertheless, that this identical famous vessel afterwards hailed from
various English ports, such as London, Yarmouth, and Southampton,
and that it was much used in transporting emigrants to this
country. What eventually became of it, and what was the end of its
career, are equally unknown to history.</p>

<p>The following list of passengers is made up from various sources.
By referring to the list of those who signed the compact at Cape Cod,
taken from Governor Bradford's folio manuscript, we know who signed
the compact, and the number of persons in the family of each; who of
the signers brought wives, and who died the first winter. By the
pocket-book of Governor Bradford we know the names and dates of the
deaths of sixteen who died the first season, and how many died before
the arrival of the Fortune, on the 9th of November, 1621. By an
examination of the Old Colony Records, we know to whom land was
assigned in 1624, and what families were extinct at that time; and, as
the families were arranged according to the vessel in which they came,
and an acre was granted to each individual, we know how many were at
that time in each family. Smith has also told us that none of the first
planters died during the three years preceding the close of the year
1624. By the division of cattle, in the year 1627, a record of which
was made at Plymouth, we know every individual who was living at
that date, and the relative age of each person in every family. By
wills, records, and gravestones, we know the ages of many of the Pilgrims
and their children.</p>

<p>From such materials, and with such authorities, the following table
has been constructed; and it is believed, that, although there is a
possibility of the existence of small errors which can never be proved,
the list is entirely or very nearly correct.</p>

<p>In order to save space and unnecessary printing, and to exhibit more
readily for reference some of the most important facts, the following
distinctive marks are made use of.</p>

<p>Those who signed the compact at Cape Cod, on the 11th of November,
1620, are in capitals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>The number in each family is indicated by the Arabic numeral.</p>

<p>Those who brought their wives have this mark, &#8224;.</p>

<p>Those who left them for a time in Holland or England are thus
distinguished, &#8225;.</p>

<p>Those who died before the arrival of the Fortune on the 9th of
November, 1621, have an asterisk, *.</p>

<p>Those who died before the division of cattle in 1627, are in italics.</p>

<p>The dates of those who died the first season are given as taken
from Bradford's pocket-book.</p>

<p>In the division of land in 1624, Henry Samson and Humilitie Cooper
had land assigned them among those who came in the May
Flower, and for this reason they have been generally believed to have
been among the passengers of that vessel. If such is the case they
can be placed in the family of Mr. Carver better than that of any
other. But, as Mr. Cushman is also placed on that list, it may be
reasonably inferred that others were put there for some other reasons,
as perhaps Samson and Cooper, who are therefore excluded in this
account.</p>

<p>John Goodman is marked in Bradford's manuscript as among those
who died the first season. But as his name occurs among those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
had garden lots in 1620, and also in the division of land in 1623, it
must be inferred that he was marked by mistake, or else Mr. Prince
committed an error in taking his copy for the Annals.</p>

<p>Three of the wives of the signers were left in Europe; namely, Bridgett,
the wife of Dr. Samuel Fuller, Hester, the wife of Francis Cooke,
and Elizabeth, the wife of Richard Warren. These afterwards came
over in the Ann, in 1623.</p>

<p>Five lost their wives and married again; namely, William Bradford,
who married widow Alice Southworth; Edward Winslow, who married
widow Susanna White; Isaac Allerton, who married Fear Brewster,
and afterwards, Joanna &mdash;&mdash;; Miles Standish, who married Barbara
----; and Francis Eaton, who married Christian Penn.</p>

<p>Others were married for the first time; namely, John Howland and
Elizabeth Carver; George Soule and Mary; Love Brewster and Sarah
Collier; John Alden and Priscilla Mullins; Resolved White and Judith
Vassal; Giles Hopkins and Catherine Wheldon; Edward Dotey and
Faith Clarke; John Cooke and Sarah Warren; Samuel Eaton and
Martha Billington.</p>

<p>Several of the Pilgrims had children born in New England, an
account of whom may form another article at some future time.</p>

OF THE COUNTY OF MERRIMACK, NEW HAMPSHIRE.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BY STEPHEN COLBY BADGER, ESQ., OF CONCORD.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>


<p>The History of the Courts in New Hampshire, including an account of the
various systems of Judicature from time to time, has been published in an article
contained in the American Quarterly Register, Vol. XII., prepared by
Francis Cogswell, Esq., of Dover, and in Articles contained in the New Hampshire
Repository, Vols. I. and II., prepared by William Butterfield, Esq., of
Gilmanton, Hon. Samuel D. Bell of Manchester, and the Hon. John Kelly of
Exeter, N.&nbsp;H. Nothing further need be said on this subject.</p>

<p>The County of Merrimack, by an act of the Legislature, passed in 1823, was
formed from the Counties of Hillsborough and Rockingham, with the exception
of a part of the town of Franklin, which was taken from Sanbornton, then in
Stratford County, now in the County of Belknap. It contains twenty-four
towns.</p>

<p>The Counties of Hillsborough and Merrimack compose the Second Judicial
District for the transaction of business of the Superior Court, and Courts are
held annually at Concord on the second Tuesday of July, and at Amherst on the
second Tuesday of December.</p>

<p>The following list of Judges, County Officers and Members of the Bar,
include those who resided within the limits of the County of Merrimack before
its formation, and also those who have resided within the County since it was
formed.</p>

IN MASSACHUSETTS.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BY EBENEZER ALDEN, M. D.</p>


<p class="center">To the Editor of the New England Historical and Genealogical Register.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>In accordance with your suggestion, I propose to send you occasionally for
publication, as your limits may permit, brief notices and reminiscences of
Physicians, who have lived in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The plan of your Periodical requires that such notices should be brief; and
I shall usually refer your readers to the sources of information, from which my
materials have been obtained, so as to facilitate the investigations of those who
may wish in any case to make still further inquiries.</p>

<p>Perhaps no class of public men is so little known to the community beyond
the limited circle of professional pursuits, as physicians. Their life is one of
incessant confinement, anxiety, and toil. A portion of their labors, as large as
from one fourth to one third, is gratuitous. To them, if to no others, it is an
abiding truth, <em>The poor always ye have with you</em>. It is exceedingly rare even
in cities, still more so in the country, to find a physician of honorable standing
with his fellows, who has acquired great wealth as the fruit of professional
service. Having food and raiment, he must learn therewith to be content.
Nevertheless, physicians find abundant sources of enjoyment in the sympathy
and kindness of many attached friends; and it is believed, that, according to the
measure of their ability, they are not behind the average of their fellow-citizens
in works of philanthropy and benevolence. In the war of the Revolution they
were fully represented in the senate-house, and on the battle-field; and the
names of Prescott, Holton, Thomas, Brooks, and Warren, with many others, will
go down to posterity, no less honored as statesmen and patriots, than as eminent
members of the medical profession.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to recall the virtues of such men; to know where they lived;
who were their associates; how they performed the duties of social life; what
obstacles they encountered and what rewards they obtained; and to hold
forth their example to the younger members of the profession and especially to
those just about to enter it, as a practical illustration of the great truth, that a
life perseveringly devoted to the good of others, even under the most discouraging
circumstances, will ultimately secure the public confidence, and meet
its reward.</p>

<p class="center">Respectfully, yours.

<h3>1.&mdash;DR. ERASTUS SERGEANT, SENIOR, OF STOCKBRIDGE.</h3>

<p>The following Notice of a distinguished physician and worthy
man is copied, with little alteration, from a letter addressed to myself
by Dr. Oliver Partridge, in December, 1841, when he was over
ninety years of age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Erastus Sergeant</span> was born at Stockbridge, August 7, 1742,
and died November 14, 1814, aged 72.</p>

<p>He was the son of Rev. John Sergeant, the first missionary to the
Indians on the Housatonic River, who was born in Newark, N. J.,
in 1710; graduated at Yale College in 1729; was there a Tutor
four years, and, having a great desire to be a missionary to the
Aborigines, went to Litchfield, in 1733, where some English
people had settled; procured a guide and went on foot forty miles
further through the wilderness, to the Indians, where he met a cordial
reception. He then returned to New Haven, resigned his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Tutorship, and, having made the necessary preparations, went
back in 1734, and commenced his mission.</p>

<p>In 1735 Gov. Dudley appointed a meeting of the Indians on
business at Deerfield, where the Rev. John Sergeant was ordained
as their minister, and he with Mr. Timothy Woodbridge as schoolmaster,
(afterwards Hon. Timothy W.,) went to spend their lives
with the Indians.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Sergeant married Abigail, the daughter of Col.
Ephraim Williams, of Newton, near Boston, one of the chosen six
who had farms allotted them across our pleasant hill, to be society
for the two missionaries.</p>

<p>Mr. Sergeant died in 1749, in the midst of his usefulness, a most
amiable man and greatly lamented. He left three children: Erastus,
the subject of this memoir; Electa, who married Col. Mark
Hopkins of Great Barrington, and was grandmother to the two
brothers, Mark and Albert Hopkins, the former the President and
the latter a Professor at Williams College; and John, the fourth
missionary to the said Indians, who removed with them in 1788, then
being about four hundred and fifty in number, to Oneida County,
N. Y., and there died.</p>

<p>Their mother married for her second husband, Gen. Joseph
Dwight of Great Barrington, who then had five children, and by her
he had two more, from whom our Dwights and Sedgwicks are
descended,&mdash;and their mother became again a widow.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the difficulties of the war with the French and
Indians of Canada, and the residing on the frontier with the care
of his, hers, and their children, by the influence and assistance of
their friends, Erastus was prepared for college, and spent two
years at Princeton, N. J., before the circumstances of the family
required his return.</p>

<p>In 1761 he went to live with his uncle, Dr. Thomas Williams of
Deerfield, and was there about three years in the study and practice
of medicine. In January, 1765, he commenced the practice of
physic in Stockbridge. The towns in the vicinity were then but
partially settled, and not supplied with physicians, so that he soon
had much business. Several severe cases of comminuted fracture,
successfully treated by him, served to extend his fame, and, in a
short time his advice was much sought, and in surgical cases he
became the principal operator within a circle of thirty miles diameter;
and his usefulness was continued until Dr. Jones and others
succeeded him in business.</p>

<p>He was endowed with sound judgment and skill in his profession;
was sedate, kind, very charitable and benevolent, with a large
share of the Christian graces, and truly was the "<em>beloved physician</em>."
More than twenty young men studied medicine under his direction.</p>

<p>It was said of him, that no one ever spoke ill of him from his
youth up. He was an important member and deacon in the Rev.
Dr. West's church. He received a Master's degree at Yale College
in 1784; was elected a Fellow of the Massachusetts Medical
Society in 1785; was a Justice of the Peace, and a Major in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
South Regiment of the County; and was obliged to keep garrison
with the Regiment at Lake Champlain, from December, 1776, to
April, 1777, and to perform other services in troublesome times,
until Burgoyne's surrender.</p>

<p>Some years before his death he was afflicted with symptoms of
pulmonary disease, which were much aggravated by his incessant
attention to his daughter, who died of consumption. In September
of 1814 he visited the "springs," in company with Dr. Partridge,
without benefit, indeed, to his injury; for it was with difficulty that
he returned, on account of his increasing weakness. The day
before his death, he had so far recruited that he rode to Lee on
horseback, visited his son's family, and returned, not complaining
of fatigue. The day he died, he was abroad in the morning.
Dr. Partridge adds, "Two friends called on us from New York, and
as we sat at dinner, in social conversation, Dr. Sergeant suddenly
rose, and a stream of blood issued from his mouth. I instantly
sprang to him, and he fell lifeless into my arms, without a gasp.
Thus expired my dear friend, under whose roof I had resided from
my twentieth year, then forty three and a half years, and more than
forty of them harmoniously visiting each other's patients, as necessary
to their satisfaction and our accommodation."</p>

<p>Dr. P. adds, "<i lang="la">natus fui</i>, April 15, 1751."</p>


<h3>II.&mdash;DR. HORATIO JONES OF STOCKBRIDGE.</h3>

<p>This able and distinguished physician, the pupil and associate of
Dr. Sergeant, (No. I.,) was the son of Capt. Josiah Jones, and
grandson of Mr. Josiah Jones, who, in 1737, emigrated from Weston
with Col. Ephraim Williams of Newton, and settled with their
families in Stockbridge. This sacrifice they cheerfully made, with
the benevolent intention of aiding the mission, then recently commenced
among the Housatonic Indians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Jones</span> was born at Stockbridge, in 1770. In early youth he
manifested the same energy and decision of character for which
he was so much distinguished in riper years. Having commenced
his collegiate education at Yale College with flattering prospects;
and, perhaps, in his ambition to excel, pursuing his studies with an
intensity of application disproportionate to his power of endurance,
his health became impaired, and he was attacked with a disease in
his eyes, which threatened a total loss of sight. In these circumstances,
in accordance with the recommendation of his medical
advisers, he for a time entirely relinquished his literary pursuits.</p>

<p>Instead of yielding to hopeless despondency, however, he determined
to pursue an active life; and substituting a knapsack for his
classics, he went with a company of surveyors to the Genesee
country, New York, to assist in laying out lands. He was thus
exposed to all the hardships incident to that mode of life, camping
out in the wilderness, living upon the coarsest fare, and not unfrequently
making a hollow log his lodging place for the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>In due time he recovered his health and sight, and once more
resumed his studies, but not at college. Placing himself under
the instruction of Dr. Sergeant in his native town, he completed the
usual term of medical pupilage. At a subsequent period he
attended a course of medical lectures at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>He first commenced the practice of his profession at Pittsfield,
where he was much respected. But at length finding, as he
expressed it, that there were <em>more physicians than business</em> in that
place, he determined to remove. His decision being known to Dr.
Sergeant, then advancing in life, who was desirous of finding some
suitable person to take his place as an operating surgeon, he with
his friend Dr. Partridge earnestly solicited Dr. Jones to settle in
Stockbridge. With this invitation he eventually complied, and
while he lived, the medical intercourse of the three physicians was
most harmonious.</p>

<p>Under these auspices he was soon introduced into a wide circle
of business, not only in Stockbridge, but in all the neighboring
towns. His reputation was not ephemeral, but constantly increased,
as he advanced in life; and his advice was much sought
and highly appreciated by his medical brethren. In 1804 he was
elected a Fellow of the Massachusetts Medical Society, and in
1810 received from Williams College the honorary degree of M. A.</p>

<p>Such was Dr. Jones,&mdash;a man possessed of rare endowments,
and eminent in his profession. In the language of Dr. Partridge,
from whom most of the facts relating to him have been obtained,
"he was a good operator in surgery, active, pleasant, social, very
popular, and indefatigable by night and by day to give relief in
cases of distress and danger."</p>

<p>In the winter of 1812-13, an alarming and fatal epidemic prevailed
extensively in New England. During its prevalence, Dr.
Jones was incessantly occupied in attendance upon the sick. At
length the fears of his friends respecting him were realized. He
was suddenly prostrated, and, after an illness of only eight days, he
died, April 26, 1813, aged 43 years.</p>

<p>His funeral was attended by a great concourse of persons from
Stockbridge and the adjoining towns. The Rev. Dr. Hyde of Lee,
who preached his funeral sermon, from Job xix: 21, speaks of his
death as a public calamity. "Rarely," says he, "has the town, or
even the county, experienced a greater shock in the death of a
citizen. His removal in the midst of his usefulness is an unspeakable
loss to the community."</p>

<p>His death is represented to have been eminently peaceful. Although
he had not made a public profession of his faith, he experienced
a great change in his religious feelings during the winter
preceding his death. He gave to those who best knew him, satisfactory
evidence of piety.</p>

<p>In his intercourse with his medical brethren, he was courteous
and unassuming. All the duties of domestic and social life he
discharged with fidelity and acceptance. His mind was well bal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>anced
and highly cultivated. He sympathized in the most unaffected
manner with the sick who sought his aid, and by his kindness
and gentleness alleviated the sufferings and won the affections
of his patients, even in those cases where medical and surgical skill
could afford only a temporary and partial relief.</p>

<p>Extracts from the sermon of Dr. Hyde were published in the
tenth volume of the Panoplist; also, an interesting notice of his
death and character, by Rev. Jared Curtis, in the Farmer's Herald.
See also a memoir recently prepared and published by Dr. S. S.
Williams, in his Medical Biography, a work which cannot fail to
interest the medical reader, and is an able sequel to the volumes of
the late Dr. Thatcher on the same subject.</p>


<h3>III.&mdash;DR. ANDREW MACKIE OF WAREHAM.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Mackie</span> was the son of Dr. John Mackie, who came from
Scotland, and settled at Southampton, L. I. He was born at
Southampton in 1742; studied medicine with his father, and settled
as a physician at Wareham, Ms., where, for many years, he had
an extensive practice in medicine and surgery. He also had the
reputation of having been unusually successful in the treatment of
the smallpox.</p>

<p>He was a devoted and active Christian, a member of the church,
and for many years he sustained the office of a deacon.</p>

<p>He had ten children, of whom four sons and three daughters
lived to adult age. Three of his sons studied medicine. 1. John,
who graduated at Brown University in 1800, received the degree
of M. D., and settled at Providence, R. I., where he died, in February,
1833, at the age of 52 years. He was eminent as a surgeon.
2. Peter, a Fellow of the Massachusetts Medical Society, now a
physician at Wareham. 3. Andrew, from whom the above-named
facts were obtained, born in 1799, graduated at Brown University,
1814, and received the degree of M. D., 1817. He first settled at
Plymouth, but is now a physician of good reputation in New
Bedford, and is a Fellow of the Massachusetts Medical Society.</p>

<p>Dr. Mackie, the particular subject of this notice, died at Wareham,
of a pulmonary disease, April, 1817, aged 75.</p>


<h3>JOHN LEVERETT, WILLIAM BRATTLE AND JAMES
OLIVER.</h3>

<p>These three distinguished scholars of New England were all born
in Boston, educated at the same school, admitted into Harvard
College the same year, took their degrees at the same time, [1680,]
all settled in Cambridge, one an attorney at law, one a clergyman,
and the other a physician, and all eminent in their professions.
The first two were Fellows of the Royal Society in England.</p>

<h2><a name="EXTRACT_FROM_A_LETTER_OF_HON_WILLIAM" id="EXTRACT_FROM_A_LETTER_OF_HON_WILLIAM">EXTRACT FROM A LETTER OF HON. WILLIAM
CRANCH OF WASHINGTON, D.&nbsp;C.</a></h2>


<p class="center">The following is an extract from a letter of Judge Cranch to the Editor.</p>

<p>"Among some old papers of my father, I found a letter from the Rev. William
Clark, dated Quincy, Aug. 10, 1803, in which he says, 'Mr. William
Winthrop of Cambridge has, for some time past, been engaged in a pursuit
rather extraordinary, viz., to investigate the following particulars of every one
who has received a degree at Harvard College, from the first foundation of that
University in 1648 to the present time; viz., the origination or where born, his
professional business or employment, his place of residence, time of his death
and age; also any thing remarkable in their lives and characters; where such
matters can be ascertained.' Again, Mr. Clark says, 'In his (Mr. Winthrop's)
next letter he opened his design to me; and with respect to the clergy in
particular, when the Catalogue was printed in 1797, the whole number of graduates
then being 3533, of which number those who had been, or then were,
settled ministers of the Gospel amounted to 1121; of this number, he informed
me he had ascertained the places of settlement, and other particulars of 1117,
so that there were but 4 remaining unascertained, viz., <em>John Mors</em>, 1692&mdash;<em>Joseph
Gerrish</em>, 1700&mdash;<em>Noyes Paris</em>, 1721&mdash;of these 2 last, however, he gives some
proof, that he was not wholly destitute of some intelligence about them. But
what is most surprising was, that of the 4 above mentioned unascertained
persons, myself brought up the rear! He had never heard where I officiated
before the revolution, though it was no further from him than <em>Dedham</em>, where I
lived ten years!&mdash;I wrote him fully of myself, and various others, whom he
has since desired information of; only there were 2 of the last mentioned, that
I knew very little about, whose names I mentioned to you: viz., whether <em>Cornelius
Nye</em>, who graduated in 1718, was not the same person who was a schoolmaster
in Braintree, and who was somewhat distinguished for his witty talents?
If so, did he ever pursue any other employment than keeping school? <em>Shepard
Fisk</em>, who graduated in 1721, and lived at Braintree, his employment,
decease and age? If you could without inconvenience to yourself, collect any
thing certain of these 2 persons, or either of them, and put it in writing and
send it to me, it would be thankfully received. I expect to have occasion to
write to Mr. Winthrop shortly, and should be happy to transmit any thing so
agreeable to him, as any discovery of this kind, whose mind seems to be
intensely fixed on this pursuit.'</p>

<p>"Mr. Clark afterwards sent to my father the following extracts from Mr.
Winthrop's letter to him, dated Oct. 10, 1803.</p>

<p>"'I feel myself greatly obliged to you, as well as to Judge Cranch, (Judge
Richard Cranch,) for the information contained in your last letter with its
inclosures. I have long since heard of that gentleman's researches into the
antiquities of this country, and conclude he must be possessed of a large fund
of information upon that subject. Is there no way that I can avail myself of
it to promote my plan?</p>

<p>"'Finding by your letter that you suppose that Mr. Sheppard, who was settled
at Cambridge, and who was an eminent minister in that day, was the same
that graduated in 1653, I inclose you some memorandums respecting that
family, which may, perhaps, be gratifying to the Judge as well as to yourself.'</p>

<p>"The postscript is in these words:&mdash;'I will thank you to present my respects
to Judge Cranch, when you have a convenient opportunity, and inform him that
I feel myself under great obligations to him for his information respecting
Messrs. Nye and Fiske; and that any further communications he will please
to make to me, I shall most gratefully acknowledge.'"</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_FROM_REV_JOHN_WALROND_OF_OTTERY_ENG_TO_REV" id="LETTER_FROM_REV_JOHN_WALROND_OF_OTTERY_ENG_TO_REV">LETTER FROM REV. JOHN WALROND OF OTTERY, ENG., TO REV.
WILLIAM WALDRON, MINISTER OF BOSTON, AND BROTHER
OF SECRETARY WALDRON.</a></h2>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 19em;"><span class="smcap">Ottery</span>, March 8, 1725-6.</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Rev. and dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>It was a very pleasant surprise to me to receive a Letter from
you, who no doubt are of the same Name and Family with myself, tho' a letter in
it be transposed, and who by Dr. Mather's Character of you, are not the least in your
Father's House.</p>

<p>I have made some Enquiry about the Somersetshire Branch of our Family, from
whence you are descended, but cannot exactly determine, tho' I am apt to think it
must be from one of those two Gentlemen, of which, one was Walrond, of <em>Illbrewers</em>
who had about five hundred Pounds pr. Annum or more, and the other Walrond of
<em>Saye</em>, of about the same Value, and I think both of them Justices of the Peace, in that
County, one of them I am sure was so, viz., the former; both of them degenerated into
looseness of Living in Charles 2ds Reign, and both ruined their Estates and dyed poor,
above twenty years since. Walrond of <em>Illbrewers</em> was a great persecutor of the Dissenters,
but in the conclusion wanted bread.</p>

<p>There is an honest family of about a hundred Pounds pr. annum, still living at
<em>Wellington</em>, in Somerset, very excellent Men, great supports of Religion, and one of
the Brothers ab<sup>t</sup> your Age, a very good young Minister, living now in Dorsetshire.</p>

<p>The Head of all our Family still remains in a good Estate, about a thousand Pounds pr.
Annum, from whom I am the second Generation. The seat is called <em>Bradfield</em> in Devon.</p>

<p>It was granted by the Crown, about six hundred years since, to one Richard Walerand,
and has continued in the Family to this Day; The last Gentleman that dyed was
a very pious good Man, about eighty years of Age and an excellent Magistrate in his
Country, that could at any time lead three hundred Freeholders, to the Election of a
Shire Knight; but his son is degenerate and very wicked: I conversed much with the
old Gentleman, but this is no Friend to my Profession.</p>

<p>Another Branch sprung from Bradfield House in this county (beside those two families
in Somerset before mentioned) which is seated at <em>Bovey</em>, in the East of Devon,
which Branch sprang from its Root about 340 years since, and now inherits at least, a
thousand Pounds per Annum; This also has degenerated and become like other Gentlemen
in England: For Religion indeed, is almost quite gone, out of the Familys of
the Gentry, by Means of a loose and licentious Clergy.</p>

<p>I never could find any of our Name, in all England, but in the Western Counties, and
from thence, a Family went, as Merchants to Barbadoes, grew rich, and was in the
Government there; and the last Gentleman a Batchelor seated himself at Greenwich
near London, was morally honest and very charitable, but having a great loss in the
South Sea, of almost all his Money could not bear it, but shot himself in the Head.</p>

<p>Our Coat of Arms, is three Bulls Heads, as you'l see by my seal on this Letter, But
<i lang="la">Stemata quid faciunt</i>?</p>

<p>I find our Name in Skinner's <cite>Etymologicon Lingu&aelig; Anglican&aelig;</cite>; toward the end of
which Book, in his <cite>Onomastichon</cite>, he has the word Walarand, <i lang="la">olim Praenomen nunc Cognomen
ab Anglo Sax</i> <span class="smcap">Walpian</span>, <i lang="la">volvere, et</i> <span class="smcap">Rand</span>, <i lang="la">Scutum, volvere scutum, i. c., qui Clypeum
huc illuc circumagit</i>. Waldron <i lang="la">autem cognomen contractum est a</i> Walarand. I have transcribed
what he says lest the Book should not be common with you. I wish you had
let me know into what Family your Grandfather married, for that might perhaps have
given Light into the Enquiry; however I will examine farther, and take the first
opportunity to inform you, as I can get Intelligence; but I know of no male Posterity
left of the two Somersetshire Familys that I mentioned above.</p>

<p>I am much pleased with your Correspondence, and shall at any time be obliged by
Letters from you, * * * send, by a worthy good Man, Capt. * * * who carries this
(as I hope he will) from the * * * Exeter to Boston. As to any Ecclesiastical Informations
I must refer you to Dr. Mather's Letter which encloses this. May the Lord
of the Harvest prosper you and make you a burning and a shining Light. You and I
are of one Family, Faith and Profession. Let us particularly pray for each other, tho'
we should never see each others face on Earth. Oh that the God of all Grace, may
excite us both, to work the Works, of him that sent us while it is Day, that we may
have a comfortable Requiem, from our Labors at last, and be accepted, when our Lord
shall come, with which I conclude.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 12.5em;">Dear Sir, Your affect: Kinsman and Serv't,</span><br />
"To the Rev. Mr. William Waldron,                        John Walrond."<br />

<h2>GENEALOGIES.<br />

CHASE FAMILY.</h2>

<p class="center">PREPARED BY JOSHUA COFFIN, M. A.</p>


<p>Among the early settlers of New England, were three persons by
the name of Chase; namely, William, Thomas, and Aquila. The first
settled in Yarmouth, and there died, in 1659, leaving two sons, Benjamin
and William. The last two were certainly brothers, as appears
from a deed given in 1667 by Aquila to "the sons of his brother
Thomas." The name is found in various places in English history,
from the time of William the Conqueror to the present time. Thus,
we find in 1326 a family of that name in Suffolk; a Thomas Chase,
who was barbarously murdered in 1506; a Sir Robert Chase, Knight,
in the West of England, 1628; a Sir John Chase in Exeter, prior to
1637; a John Chase, Esq., Apothecary to Queen Anne, 1690, &amp;c. See
Magna Britannia, Lysson's London, Polwheles' Devonshire, and other
works.</p>

<h2>INSTANCES OF LONGEVITY IN BELFAST, ME.</h2>


<p>The names of aged persons who died in this town before 1827, with
their respective ages and the times of their decease, are here inserted.</p>

<p>Of these individuals it has been said, "In their manners they
exhibited a model of perfect plainness and simplicity, indicative of
contentment and a cheerful disposition; and so cordial was their reception
of those who visited them, that with truth it might be said,
they were given to hospitality. Their descendants read the poems of
Burns with a keen relish, and are enthusiastic admirers of the Scottish

<h2>GOVERNOR BRADSTREET.</h2>


<p>Simon Bradstreet, son of a non-conforming minister, was born March, 1603,
at Horblin, Lincolnshire. His father died when he was fourteen years old, and
he was committed to the care of Hon. Thomas Dudley, for eight years following.
He spent one year at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, pursuing his studies
amidst various interruptions. Leaving Cambridge, he resided in the family of
the Earl of Lincoln, as his steward, and afterwards lived in the same capacity
with the Countess of Warwick. He with Mr. Winthrop, Mr. Dudley, and others,
agreed to emigrate, and form a settlement in Massachusetts; and being
appointed an Assistant, he with his family and others went on board the
Arbella, March 29, 1630; anchored, June 12, near Naumkeak, now Salem,
went on shore, but returned to the vessel at night; came, on the 14th, into the
inner harbor, and went on shore. He attended the first Court, Aug. 23, at
Charlestown.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1631, Mr. Bradstreet with other gentlemen commenced
building at Newtown, now Cambridge, and his name is among those constituting
the first company, which settled in that town in 1632. He resided there
several years. In 1639, the Court granted him 500 acres of land in Salem, in
the next convenient place to Gov. Endicott's farm. It appears that he resided a
short time at Ipswich.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradstreet was among the first settlers of Andover, and was highly useful
in promoting the settlement, in bearing the burdens incident to a new plantation,
and in giving a right direction to its affairs. About the year 1644, he built
the first mill on the Cochichewick. He was a selectman from the first record
of town officers to 1672, soon after which, he probably spent most of his time
in Boston and Salem. He was the first Secretary of the colony, and discharged
the duties of the office many years. He was one of the first Commissioners of
the United Colonies in 1643, and served many years with fidelity and usefulness
in this office. In 1653, he with his colleague vigorously opposed making
war on the Dutch in New York, and on the Indians; and it was prevented by
his steady and conscientious opposition and the decision of the General Court
of Massachusetts, though earnestly and strenuously urged by all the Commissioners
of the other three colonies.</p>

<p>He was Deputy Governor from 1672 to 1679, when he was elected Governor,
and continued in office till Mr. Joseph Dudley, his nephew, was appointed, in
1686, head of the administration, and the government was changed and the
Charter annulled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Gov. Bradstreet was considered at the head of the moderate party; and, when
the Charter was demanded by King Charles, he thought it better that it should
be surrendered, than that it should be taken away by judgment, as in that case
it might be more easily resumed.</p>

<p>He strenuously opposed the arbitrary proceedings of Andros; and when, in
1689, the people put down his authority, they made their old Governor their
President. He continued at the head of the administration till May, 1692, at
the advanced age of 89 years, when Sir William Phips arrived from England
with the new Charter, in which Sir William was appointed Governor, and Mr.
Bradstreet first Assistant. He had been in service in the government sixty-two
years, excepting the short administrations of Dudley and Andros. No man in the
country has continued in so high offices so many years, and to so advanced age
as he. He was a popular magistrate, and was opposed to the witch delusion in
1692, which caused great alarm and distress at the commencement of Gov.
Phips' administration. "He lived to be the Nestor of New England," for all
who came over from England with him, died before him.</p>

<p>The following inscription is on the monument erected in Salem to Gov.
Bradstreet:</p>

<p>SIMON BRADSTREET,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Armiger, ex ordine Senatoris in Colonia Massachusettensi ab anno 1630, usque ad
annum 1673. Deinde ad annum 1679, Vice-Gubernator. Denique, ad annum 1686,
ejusdem coloniae, communi et constanti populi suffragio,</p></div>


<h3>GUBERNATOR,</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Vir, judicio Lynceario praeditus; quem nec numma, nec honos allexit. Regis auctoritatem,
et populi libertatem, aequa lance libravit. Religione cordatus, vita innocuus,
mundum et vicit et deseruit, 27 die Martii, A. D. 1697, annoque Guliel: 3t. IX. et
&AElig;t. 94.</p></div>

<p>Gov. Bradstreet was married in England to Miss Ann Dudley, daughter of
Mr. Thomas Dudley, when she was sixteen years old. She is the most distinguished
of the early matrons of our country by her literary powers, of which
proof is given in a volume of poems. It was dedicated to her father in poetry,
dated March 20, 1642. The title of the book is, "Several poems, compiled
with great variety of wit and learning, full of delight; wherein especially is
contained a complete discourse and description of the four elements, constituting
ages of man, seasons of the year, together with an exact epitome of the
three first monarchies, viz., the Assyrian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman commonwealth,
from the beginning to the end of their last king, with divers other
pleasant and serious poems. By a Gentlewoman of New England." A second
edition of it was printed at Boston, 1678, by John Foster, in a respectable
12mo of 255 pp., and a third edition was published in 1758. The work does
honor to her education, by her frequent allusions to ancient literature and historical
facts, and to her character, as a daughter, a wife, a parent, and Christian.
This volume is a real curiosity, though no reader, free from partiality of
friendship, might coincide with the commendation of her in the funeral eulogy
of John Norton:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Could Maro's muse but hear her lively strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would condemn his works to fire again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her breast was a brave palace, a <em>broad street</em>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all heroic, ample thoughts did meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where nature had such a tenement ta'en,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That other souls, to her's, dwelt in a lane."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Mather, in his Magnalia, gives a high commendation of her, "whose
poems, divers times printed, have afforded a grateful entertainment unto the
ingenious, and a monument for her memory beyond the stateliest marbles."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Their children were as follows:</p>


<ol><li>Samuel, who had two daughters b. in Boston, 1663, 1665.</li>
<li>Simon, who was settled in the ministry in New London, Ct.</li>
<li>Dudley of Andover.</li>

</ol>

<p>Mrs. Bradstreet died in Andover, Sept. 16, 1672, aged 60.</p>

<p>Gov. Bradstreet married for his second wife, a sister of Sir George Downing,
who was in the first class that graduated at Harvard College, and was ambassador
of Cromwell and Charles II. to Holland. See <cite>Abbot's History of Andover</cite>.</p>

<h3>HON. WILLIAM CRANCH OF WASHINGTON, D.&nbsp;C.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Judge Cranch</span> was born at the house of his mother's father, the
Rev. William Smith, of Weymouth, Ms., July 17, 1769; and was
baptized by him the Sabbath following, as appears by the church
records.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> He had no brother, but two sisters, and these were older
than himself. The elder sister, Elizabeth, married the Rev. Jacob
Norton, who succeeded Mr. Smith in the pastoral office. The other
sister married Mr. John Greenleaf, who resides at Quincy, Ms.
Mrs. Greenleaf died Feb. 18, 1846.</p>

<p>His father, Richard Cranch, was born in Kingsbridge, near
Exeter in Devonshire, England, in November, 1726, and was the
son of John, the son of Andrew, the son of Richard, all of Devonshire.
He was one of six sons, and was bound as an apprentice
to a maker of wool-cards; but, at the age of 20, purchased the
remainder of his time, and came to this country in 1746, with General
Joseph Palmer, who had married his sister. Being fond of
books, he became a learned man, received an honorary degree of
M. A. from Harvard University, was elected a member of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences, sustained several important
public offices, and was for many years a member of the
Legislature and a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas. He
died in 1811, in his 85th year.</p>

<p>His mother was Mary, the eldest daughter of the Rev. William
Smith of Weymouth, and granddaughter of Col. John Quincy of
Mount Wollaston, in that part of Braintree since incorporated by
the name of Quincy, in honor of his memory. There is now no
lineal descendant from him of the name of Quincy. The next
daughter of Mr. Smith was Abigail, who became the wife of the
late President John Adams; and the other daughter was Elizabeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
who married the Rev. John Shaw of Haverhill, Ms., and
after his death, the Rev. Stephen Peabody of Atkinson, N.&nbsp;H. She
died April 9, 1815, aged 65. She had three children by her first
husband, William Smith, Elizabeth Quincy, and Abigail Adams.
The son was the principal founder of the Boston Athen&aelig;um. He
was born Aug. 12, 1778, graduated H. C. 1798, and died 1826.
The first daughter was born May 26, 1780, and died Sept. 4, 1798,
aged 18. The last daughter is the wife of Rev. Joseph B. Felt of
this city.</p>

<p>The great-grandmother of the subject of this sketch, the wife of
Col. John Quincy, who died July 13, 1767, was Mary Norton, the
daughter of the Rev. John Norton of Hingham, whose genealogy
is distinctly traced back to the time of William the Conqueror.</p>

<p>We cannot trace the ancestors of Judge Cranch's father back
further than his grandfather's grandfather. They all appear to have
been Dissenters, firm republicans, and honest men, but in humble
life. His grandfather, John Cranch, was a farmer and a freeholder;
the others seem to have been manufacturers of woollens. John
Cranch, the naturalist, who was, at the recommendation of Sir
Joseph Banks, sent out in the expedition to Egypt, where he died,
was his second cousin. His father's mother was Elizabeth Pearse,
daughter of Christopher Pearse and Margery Triste.</p>

<p>In April, 1775, his father removed from Boston to that part of
Braintree now called Quincy, where he resided until his death. He
died on the 16th, and his wife on the 17th, of October, 1811, and
both were buried on the same day, the 19th. A sermon was delivered
on the occasion by the Rev. Peter Whitney, which was printed.</p>

<p>Judge Cranch prepared for college under the instruction of his
uncle, the Rev. John Shaw of Haverhill, and entered the Freshman
class, six months in advance, in February, 1784. Having graduated
at Harvard College, he, July, 1787, entered the office of Judge
Dawes of Boston, who was then a practitioner in the courts of
Massachusetts, where he read law three years, and in July, 1790,
was admitted to practice in the Court of Common Pleas. He
opened an office in Braintree, now Quincy, but at the close of the
first year, upon the death of his relative, John Thaxter, Esq., who
had been in the practice of the law at Haverhill, Ms., he was
induced by his friends to remove to that place, and take his office,
and complete his unfinished business; which, with the confidence
reposed in him by the Hon. Nathaniel Peaslee Sergeant, then one
of the Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts,
who appointed him sole executor of his will, introduced him into
practice, and enabled him to support himself and pay all demands
held against him. For three years, he attended the courts in Essex
county in Massachusetts and Rockingham county in New Hampshire,
and was admitted to practice in the Supreme Judicial Court
in July, 1793.</p>

<p>In September, 1794, he was employed to superintend the affairs
of Morris, Nicholson, and Greenleaf, under their great contracts in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the City of Washington, to which place he removed in October of
that year, and has continued to reside in that place until the present
time.</p>

<p>In April, 1795, he was connected in marriage with Nancy
Greenleaf, daughter of the late William Greenleaf of Boston, and
moved his wife to Washington, in May.</p>

<p>They have been the parents of 13 children, 3 of whom died in
infancy. The names of the other ten were 1. William Greenleaf;
2. Richard; 3. Ann Allen; 4. Mary; 5. Elizabeth Eliot; 6. John;
7. Edward Pope; 8. Christopher Pearse; 9. Abby Adams; 10.
Margaret Dawes. Richard was drowned in Lake Erie, while in the
discharge of his duty as an assistant-engineer, surveying the harbor,
in his 29th year, unmarried. Ann Allen died in April, 1821, of consumption,
aged 22, also unmarried. Mary married Richard Cranch
Norton, and died when her first child was one week old, in July,
1821, aged 20. Her husband died in October of the same year.</p>

<p>The other 7 children are still living. Elizabeth married Rufus
Dawes, a son of the late Judge Dawes of Boston. Abby Adams
married the Rev. William G. Eliot of St. Louis, Missouri, where
they reside and have a number of children. William has been a
clerk in the Patent Office. He was two years at Harvard University;
but his delicate health and feeble constitution obliged him to leave
his studies in his Junior year. The other sons were educated at
the Columbian College in the District of Columbia. John spent
three or four years in Italy, in drawing and painting, to perfect his
knowledge of these branches, and now resides in Boston, where
he pursues the employment of drawing and painting. Edward
Pope is settled in Cincinnati as a lawyer. Christopher Pearse has
been a preacher of the Gospel, but has lately turned his attention to
portrait painting, and is now in Italy. Mrs. Cranch deceased
Sept. 17, 1843.</p>

<p>In the year 1800, Judge Cranch was appointed one of the Commissioners
of the City of Washington, which office he resigned in
1801, when he was, by President Adams, appointed the junior
assistant Judge of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia,
under the act of Congress of Feb. 27, 1801; the late Governor
Thomas Johnson of Maryland, who had been one of the Commissioners
of the City of Washington, having been appointed Chief
Judge; and Mr. James Marshall, brother of the late Chief Justice
Marshall, having been appointed elder assistant Judge. Gov. Johnson
refused to accept the office; and Mr. Jefferson appointed William
Kitty, Esq., Chief Judge. Mr. Marshall resigned in 1803, and
Nicholas Fitzhugh, Esq., of Virginia, was appointed in his place.</p>

<p>In 1805, Mr. Kitty having been appointed Chancellor of Maryland,
Judge Cranch was appointed by Mr. Jefferson to the office of
Chief Justice, which office he now holds; and by virtue of that
office is sole Judge of the <em>District</em> Court of the United States, for
the District of Columbia, which has the same jurisdiction as the
other District Courts of the United States have.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>He has published nine volumes of Reports of cases in the
Supreme Court of the United States, a Memoir of the life, character,
and writings of President John Adams, (70 pages,) read before
the Columbian Institute, March 16, 1827, and an Address upon the
subject of Temperance, in 1831, a small pamphlet.</p>

<p>Judge Cranch is a Member of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences, and of the American Antiquarian Society. He has
received also the degree of Doctor of Laws from Harvard College.</p>


<h3>PROFESSOR EBENEZER ADAMS OF HANOVER, N.&nbsp;H.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Adams</span> was the son of Ephraim Adams of New Ipswich,
N.&nbsp;H., who was a highly respectable man, having been a
magistrate, an officer in the church, and a representative of the town.
He was born in that place, Oct. 2, 1765. The father was a native
of Ipswich, Ms., born in that part of the town which is now Hamilton.
He was brought up on the farm which was first occupied by
his ancestor, one of the eight sons of Henry Adams, who came to
this country from Devonshire, England, and settled in that part of
Braintree now called Quincy, about the year 1630. The father of
Dea. Adams, whose baptismal name was Thomas, was either the
grandson or great-grandson of this ancestor. The first wife of
Dea. Adams was Rebecca, daughter of James Locke, who was a
native of Woburn, Ms., and died in Ashby, Ms. The name of his
second wife is not known. The children of Dea. Adams were
fifteen in number.</p>

<p>The subject of this sketch fitted for college at the Academy in
New Ipswich, under the care of Hon. John Hubbard, who was
afterwards Professor in Dartmouth College. Having graduated
at that institution in 1791, with high reputation as a scholar,
especially in mathematics and philosophy, he went immediately
into the Academy at Leicester, Ms., where he spent fifteen years,
fourteen of which he was the Principal. In 1806, he took charge of
the Academy at Portland, Me., which he left after a year and a half,
having accepted the Professorship of Mathematics in Phillips
Academy, Exeter. In 1809 he was appointed Professor of the
Languages in Dartmouth College, and in 1810, upon the death of
Professor Hubbard, he was transferred to the department of Mathematics
and Natural Philosophy, and continued in that office until
1833&mdash;twenty-three years&mdash;when he was induced by advancing
age and infirmities to resign all active and responsible service in
the College; his connection with it since being simply that of
Professor Emeritus, which continued until his death.</p>

<p>Professor Adams possessed great constitutional energies, both
physical and mental. These he carried into active life. As an
instructor he was able and accurate. No one surpassed him in
faithfulness, and hence it was proverbial that he made thorough
scholars. In the Languages he was good, but in Mathematics and
Philosophy he excelled as a teacher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>As would naturally be expected, he took a lively interest in all
efforts made to promote the cause of literature, the sciences, and the
arts, and was connected with several literary associations. He was
an original Member of the Northern Academy of Arts and Sciences,
and took an active part at the time of its formation, as presiding
officer. He was also a Member of the New Hampshire Historical
Society, the American Antiquarian Society, the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences, the Maryland Academy of Sciences and
Literature, and the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries, Copenhagen.
He was a Trustee of Kimball Union Academy in Plainfield,
and sustained the office of President of the Board of Trustees
twenty years, and, for about as long a time, he was President of the
New Hampshire Bible Society.</p>

<p>Professor Adams was twice married. His first wife was Alice
Frink, daughter of Dr. John Frink, a distinguished physician of Rutland,
Ms., by whom he had five children, Alice A., Adeline A., John,
Charles A. and Harriet R., of whom John only is now living. He
graduated at Dartmouth College in 1817, and is now a practising
attorney in Mobile, Ala. His second wife was Beulah Minot,
daughter of Dr. Timothy Minot of Concord, Ms. By her he had
two children, Eliza M. and Ebenezer. The daughter is now the
wife of Prof. Ira Young. Ebenezer was graduated at Dartmouth
College in 1831, and died in July, 1837. Of seven children, therefore,
two only survive. The last Mrs. Adams still lives, and
resides with her daughter, Mrs. Young.</p>

<p>Professor Adams "was one of the few remaining old school
citizens and scholars of New England, and was hardly surpassed
by any of that venerable class of men in intelligence, patriotism,
and Christian virtue." He possessed a well balanced mind, "was
judicious, magnanimous, and firm." He died calm and happy in
the triumphs of religion, August 15, 1841, in the 76th year of his
age, from ossification of the heart.</p>


<h3>HON. JAMES SAVAGE OF BOSTON.</h3>

<p>The subject of this sketch was born July 11, 1784, in Boston,
where his progenitors since 1635 have always lived. His father
was Habijah, and his mother, Elizabeth, daughter of John Tudor.
Of eight children, five sons and three daughters, born before him,
two sons died in infancy; the rest attained full age, as did also two
sons younger than himself.</p>

<p>His mother died before he arrived at his fourth year of age; and
his father, by reason of ill health, was unable to take charge of him
in his early education. The Rev. Dr. Thacher preached on the
occasion of his mother's death from Psalms xxvii: 10&mdash;"<em>When my
father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.</em>"</p>

<p>The father of Mr. Savage was son of Thomas, by his first wife,
Deborah Briggs, who was, it is believed, a granddaughter of John
Cushing, one of the Judges of the Superior Court of the Province
of Massachusetts Bay. John, his father's elder brother, was father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
of Thomas of York, Me., from whom descended the Savages in
Bangor. His grandfather's second wife was Sarah Cheever, who
survived him nearly fifty-one years. One of their children was the
late Ezekiel Savage, Esq., of Salem, H. C. 1778, father of Rev.
Thomas Savage of Bedford, N.&nbsp;H., H. C. 1813, and several other
children, of whom one, Sarah, distinguished herself by the composition
of some interesting books.</p>

<p>Habijah, father of Mr. Savage's grandfather Thomas, was
educated at Harvard College, where he received his first degree, in
1695. He married Hannah, who had been a short time widow of
---- Anderson. She was a daughter of Samuel Phillips, distinguished
among booksellers in Boston one hundred and fifty years
ago, as John Dunton mentions in the entertaining account of his
visit to our country, published in his "Life and Errors." Arthur,
a younger brother of his great-grandfather, married another daughter
of Mr. Phillips, and one of their children was Samuel Phillips
Savage, father of the late Samuel Savage, H. C. 1766, of Barnstable.</p>

<p>Thomas, father of the last named Habijah, born 1640, was
second child of Thomas, who emigrated from England. His
mother was Faith, daughter of William and the celebrated Ann
Hutchinson, who was a <em>speaking</em> if not a <em>ruling</em> elder in the First
Church in Boston. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Joshua Scottow,
author of two curious tracts in the latter part of the 17th century.
With two of his brothers, Ephraim, H. C. 1662, and Perez, he
served at various times and places in King Philip's war, in the early
part of which, their father was in the chief command of the forces
of the Colony of Massachusetts. Ephraim gained some reputation
in command of one of the vessels of the fleet, in the daring
but disastrous expedition from Boston against Quebec, by Sir
William Phips, in 1690, and Thomas was at the head of one of
the three regiments engaged in it, and wrote a brief and modest
account of the service, published the following year at London. He
died July 2, 1705.</p>

<p>Mr. Savage's great-great-great-grandfather, Thomas, was a man
of high public spirit. Disgusted with the treatment of the majority
towards Wheelwright and other friends of Sir Henry Vane, whom
he had perhaps accompanied from England, he, with Gov. Coddington
and others, removed in 1638, and purchased Rhode Island.
He soon returned, however, to Boston, recovered his former standing
with early friends, and was often one of the representatives of
the town, and, in the trying times of 1665, was respected for his moderation.
He was one of those who undertook, in 1673, to erect a
barricade in the harbor, for security against a fleet then expected
from Holland. Out of this barricade grew, in less than forty years,
the Long Wharf, a small portion of which has continued ever since
the property of some members of the family. He was Speaker of
the Deputies in 1659, and again after an interval of eleven years,
and in 1680 was chosen by the colony one of the Assistants, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
which station he died, Feb. 14, 1682, aged 75. A funeral sermon
on that event is among the printed works of Rev. Samuel Willard,
pastor of the <em>third</em> church, of which Major Savage was one of the
founders, at the secession occasioned by the coming of Davenport
from New Haven to the <em>first</em>. The text was, Isaiah lvii: 1.</p>

<p>The eldest son of this ancestor of most who bear the name on
this side of the ocean, Habijah, H. C. 1659, died in a few years,
but left children by his wife, daughter of Edward Tyng, one of the
Assistants. A grandchild of these parents removed from Boston,
early in the last century, to Charleston, S. C., where he is commemorated
by Dr. Ramsay, in his History of the Independent
Church in that city. Descendants have been known in different
parts of South Carolina and Georgia. The late Judge Clay of the
latter state, afterwards pastor of the first Baptist Church in Boston,
married one, and his son, Thomas Savage Clay, H. C. 1819, is
highly respected for his Christian philanthropy.</p>

<p>In the catalogue of the sons of Harvard are numbered eleven
lineal descendants of the first Thomas, of whom six have been
noticed. John, 1694, was son of Ephraim; Habijah, 1723, was
either son or nephew of Habijah; John, 1810, and James Rodon,
1812, were sons of William Savage, Esq., of Jamaica, son of
Samuel Phillips Savage, before mentioned.</p>

<p>Of the progenitors of Mr. Savage, no means are possessed by
which to trace the line before the arrival of his ancestor in this
country; but a family tradition, committed to writing many years
since, makes him to have been a brother of Arthur, an English dean.</p>

<p>Mr. Savage fitted for college at Derby Academy, Hingham,
under the tuition of Abner Lincoln, and at Washington Academy,
Machias, Me., instructed by Daniel P. Upton.</p>

<p>After graduating at Harvard University in 1803, he studied law
under the direction of the late Chief Justice Parker, Hon. Samuel
Dexter, and Hon. William Sullivan, and entered upon its practice
January, 1807.</p>

<p>Mr. Savage has been Representative and Senator in General
Court, a Counsellor, and a Delegate to the Convention in 1820 for
amending the Constitution of the State. He has been also in the
City government as one of the Common Council and an Alderman,
as well as one of the School Committee.</p>

<p>In April, 1823, he married Elizabeth O., widow of James Otis
Lincoln, Esq., of Hingham. She was daughter of George Stillman
of Machias, Me., an officer in the war of the Revolution.
Their children are Emma, Harriet, Lucy, and James.</p>

<p>At times letters have engaged the attention of Mr. Savage, but
not to withdraw him from the proper duties of his profession or the
service of the community in active life. He was during four or
five years associated with the gentlemen who edited the (Boston)
Monthly Anthology, and contributed articles for that work, as he
has also for the North American Review. At the request of the
municipal authorities of Boston, he delivered an oration, July 4,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
1811. The compilation of the Colonial and Provincial Laws of
Massachusetts, published under the title of Ancient Charters,
according to direction of General Court, by the late Hon. Nathan
Dane, Judge Prescott, and Judge Story, was by these gentlemen
confided to his supervision while passing through the press. The
Index to the work was prepared by him. He superintended an
edition of Paley's Works; and the presswork of the ten volumes
of American State Papers, selected by Hon. John Q. Adams, under
authority of Congress. But Mr. Savage's greatest effort of this
nature was his edition of Gov. Winthrop's History of New England,
with notes.</p>

<p>This is a work of much labor and value. It is understood that
he has in contemplation a new edition of Farmer's Genealogical
Register of the First Settlers of New England.</p>

<p>Mr. Savage was more than twenty years Secretary or Treasurer
of the first Savings Bank in Boston, and nineteen years Treasurer
of the Massachusetts Historical Society, of which he is now the
President. He is a Member of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences, and has received the degree of LL. D. at Harvard
College.</p>

<p>Forty-one years since, for the benefit of his health, he, in
company with his relative and friend, William Tudor, Jr., visited
the islands of Martinique, Dominique, St. Thomas, St. Domingo,
and Jamaica. Since, he has been to Demerara, and five years ago,
he went to England, with a view of visiting his fathers' sepulchres,
and of enjoying himself in the father-land.</p>


<h3>HON. LEVI WOODBURY OF PORTSMOUTH, N.&nbsp;H.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Levi Woodbury</span> was born at Francestown, N.&nbsp;H., Dec. 22, 1789,
where his father, the Hon. Peter Woodbury, resided. <em>He</em> was born
in Beverly, Ms., in 1767, removed to New Hampshire with his
father, and, when he entered upon the active business of life for himself,
engaged in mercantile and agricultural pursuits, and was about
fifteen years a Representative, and two years a Senator, in the State
Legislature. He died in 1834. <em>He</em> was son of Peter Woodbury,
who was born March 28, 1738, at Beverly, and married there, and in
1773 removed to Mont Vernon, then a part of Amherst, N.&nbsp;H. He
spent the last twenty years of his life at Antrim, with his youngest
son, Mark Woodbury, Esq., where he died, March, 1819, aged 85.
<em>His</em> father was Josiah Woodbury of Beverly, who was born June 15,
1682, and lived in the Second or Upper Parish. The father of Josiah
was Peter, who was born in 1640, made a freeman in 1668, and
elected a Representative in 1689. He filled the office of deacon,
and died July 5, 1704, aged 64. His father was Humphrey
Woodbury, who was born in 1609, came to New England with his
father, John Woodbury, in 1628, was admitted to the church in 1648,
was a member of the First Church in Beverly, at its formation, was
chosen deacon in 1668, and was living in 1681. John Woodbury,
who was one of the original settlers of Beverly, came from Somer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>setshire,
England, under the direction of the Dorchester company,
which established itself at Cape Ann about 1624. He came to
Salem in 1626, was made a freeman in 1630, and in 1635 was
chosen a Deputy to General Court. He was an original member
of the First Church in Salem. In 1636, he received a grant of two
hundred acres of land on Bass river. He died in 1641.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodbury's mother was Mary Woodbury, daughter of
James Woodbury, who was born in Beverly, but removed to Mont
Vernon, N.&nbsp;H., in 1782. He was a subaltern in Col. Robert Rogers'
regiment of Rangers, and was near Wolfe when he fell at the
storming of Quebec. The sword he used in that service is now in
the possession of a descendant. He had eight children, all daughters,
and died at Francestown, March, 1823, aged 86.</p>

<p>The subject of this sketch was prepared for college in part at
New Ipswich Academy, N.&nbsp;H., with Mr. Mulliken, but chiefly
under the instruction of Hon. John Vose, the distinguished Preceptor
of Atkinson Academy. In 1805 he entered Dartmouth
College, where he remained till 1809, when he graduated with high
reputation for talents and acquirements.</p>

<p>Immediately after leaving college he commenced the study of
law, spending one year at the Law School of Judges Reeve and
Gould, at Litchfield, Ct., and the residue of his preparatory course
with Hon. S. Dana of Boston, Judge Smith of Exeter, and James
Walker, Esq., of Francestown. In 1812 he opened an office in
his native place, where he remained till 1819. In 1816 he was
elected Clerk of the State Senate, and, in the year following, was
appointed Judge of the Superior Court. This appointment to the
bench of the highest judicial tribunal of the state, drew general
attention to the manner in which the duties were discharged. Ample
testimony, however, of the qualifications of Judge Woodbury may
be found in the first two volumes of New Hampshire Reports. In
1819, he removed to Portsmouth, the commercial capital of New
Hampshire, where he continues to reside. In 1823 he was chosen
Governor of the State, and when his term of office expired, he
returned to the practice of his profession. In 1825 he was chosen
Representative from Portsmouth, and on the meeting of the Legislature,
he was elected Speaker of the House. Among the last acts
of the session was the choice of Gov. Woodbury to fill a vacancy
which had occurred in the Senate of the United States. At the
commencement of the session in 1825-6, he took his seat in the
Senate, and during the six years succeeding, his name was connected
with the most important measures discussed in that body.
His term of service expired on the 4th of March, and four days
after, he was chosen State Senator for the district in which he
resided. In April following, he was invited by President Jackson
to become Secretary of the Navy, which office he was induced to
accept, having declined that of State Senator. July 4, 1834, he
was appointed Secretary of the Treasury, in which capacity he
served till March 3, 1841. During this time, he was appointed
Chief Justice of the Superior Court of New Hampshire, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
declined the office. In 1841, he was again chosen U. S. Senator
from New Hampshire, which office he held till September, 1845,
when he was appointed an Associate Justice of the U. S. Supreme
Court. In the summer previous, the office of Minister to England
was tendered to him, but he refused it on account of the situation
of his family.</p>

<p>In June, 1819, Judge Woodbury was married to Eliza W. Clapp,
daughter of Hon. Asa Clapp of Portland, Me. They have five
children: Charles Levi, who is now an attorney in Boston, Mary
Elizabeth, Frances Anstris, Virginia Lafayette, and Ellen Carolina.
The eldest is married to the Hon. Montgomery Blair of St. Louis, Mo.</p>

<p>Judge Woodbury has published one volume of Law Reports in
connection with Judge Richardson, also speeches, pamphlets, and
reports relating to the various official duties he has performed,
besides numerous literary addresses. He has received the degree
of Doctor of Laws at the Wesleyan University in Connecticut,
and at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. He is also a member
of various literary societies.</p>

<p>The brothers and sisters of Judge Woodbury are Peter P.
Woodbury, M. D., of Bedford, N.&nbsp;H., now Vice-President of the
New Hampshire Medical Society; Rev. James Trask Woodbury of
Acton, Ms., formerly an attorney; Jesse Woodbury, Esq., who resides
on the paternal estate; George Washington Woodbury, M. D.,
Yazoo county, Mississippi; Mrs. Mary Howe, widow of the late
Luke Howe, M. D., of Jaffrey, N.&nbsp;H.; Mrs. Anstris B. Eastman, wife
of Hon. Nehemiah Eastman of Farmington, N.&nbsp;H., formerly Member
of Congress; Mrs. Martha W. Grimes of Quincy, Ms., widow
of the late Thomas Grimes, merchant, of Windsor, Vt.; Mrs. Hannah
T. Barnes, wife of Isaac O. Barnes, Esq., of Boston, U. S.
Marshal for the District of Massachusetts; Mrs. Harriet Dodge, wife
of Perley Dodge, Esq., an attorney at Amherst, N.&nbsp;H.; Mrs. Adeline
Bunnelle, wife of Edwin F. Bunnelle, Esq., of Boston, clerk
in the Custom House.</p>


<h3>HON. SAMUEL S. WILDE OF BOSTON.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Samuel Sumner Wilde</span> was born in Taunton, Feb. 5, 1771. His
father's name was Daniel, who was born in Braintree in 1718, and
died in 1792. <em>His</em> father, if not born in England and brought over
by his father when a child, was born in Braintree.</p>

<p>The father of the subject of this sketch, soon after arriving at the
age of 21, settled in Taunton, where he continued until the time of
his death. He was a farmer and a pious man, and for many years
was one of the deacons of the only Congregational Church then
in that town. He was very fond of sacred music, and had a fine
voice, well cultivated, and, for those days, he had a competent
degree of skill and knowledge of the science to render him an
acceptable leader of the choir in the church, and was a leader long
before he was chosen deacon. In his family devotions he always
read a chapter in the Bible, sung a hymn in which some of the
family joined, and concluded with a prayer. He was twice married.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
His first wife was the daughter of Deacon Staples of Taunton,
grandfather of Mr. Staples, a lawyer of considerable eminence in
New York.</p>

<p>His second wife, the mother of Samuel S., was the only child
of Deacon Samuel Sumner, also of Taunton. Dea. Sumner was
well educated for one who had not received a collegiate course of
instruction, had a taste for study, and thought much of learning and
learned men. He died when Samuel S., who was his only grandson,
was two years old, and bequeathed to him a lot of land, which
he authorized his father to sell, and to expend the proceeds in giving
him a college education, if he should, at a proper age, manifest any
taste and talents, which would probably render such an education
useful to him. He was a warm Whig and a friend to the liberties
of the people; and it was probably owing to discussions about the
Stamp Act and other difficulties with England, and his reflections
on the inalienable rights of man, that he emancipated a female
slave, about the year 1769 or 1770. She, however, always continued
in the family upon wages, until her death. Dea. Sumner was a
distant relation of Gov. Sumner and also of the Rev. Dr. Sumner,
long the minister of Shrewsbury in the county of Worcester.</p>

<p>The mother of Samuel S. was a most excellent woman, and
distinguished for her mental endowments, piety, and zeal in the
cause of religion.</p>

<p>The subject of this sketch fitted for college under the direction
of Rev. Ephraim Judson, the minister of Taunton, and entered the
Sophomore class at Dartmouth College, in 1786, where he graduated
in 1789. He read law in Taunton with David L. Barnes,
Esq., who was afterwards Judge of the District Court of the United
States for the state of Rhode Island. In September, 1792, he was
admitted to the bar, and the same year was married to Eunice
Cobb, a daughter of the late Gen. Cobb of Taunton. He immediately
removed to Maine, and first commenced practice in Waldoborough
in the county of Lincoln, where he remained only two
years, and then removed to the adjoining town of Warren, where
he resided five years, when, in 1799, he removed to Hallowell. He
represented the town of Warren two years in the House of Representatives;
but after his removal to Hallowell, he devoted himself
wholly to his profession. He was, however, twice chosen one of
the Electors of President and Vice-President of the United States,
and in 1814 was elected a State Counsellor. He was also one of
the Delegates to the famous Hartford Convention. In June, 1815,
he was appointed Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts,
which office he now holds. He was a member from
Newburyport of the Convention for revising the Constitution of the
state, having removed from Hallowell to that place in 1820. In
1831 he removed to Boston, where he still resides.</p>

<p>The wife of Judge Wilde deceased June 6, 1826. Their children
were nine, of whom only four survive. The two eldest sons died
unmarried. The eldest daughter, Eunice, married Hon. William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Emmons of Augusta, Me., a son of Rev. Dr. Emmons of Franklin,
Ms. She died in 1821, leaving two daughters, one of whom has
since deceased, and the other is the wife of Rev. Mr. Tappan of
Hampden, Me., son of Rev. Dr. Tappan of Augusta, Me. The
second daughter, Eleanor Bradish, married I. W. Mellen, Esq.,
son of Rev. Mr. Mellen of Cambridge. They are both dead. Mrs.
Mellen died in March, 1838, leaving three children. The third
daughter, Caroline, married Hon. Caleb Cushing of Newburyport,
and died in 1832. The eldest surviving son, George Cobb, Esq.,
an attorney at law, is Clerk of the Courts in Suffolk county, is
married, and has two children. The second surviving son, Henry
Jackson, is married, and has two children, and is now settled in
Washington, D.&nbsp;C. The youngest son is unmarried. The only
surviving daughter was first married to Frederick W. Doane of
Boston, and is now the wife of Robert Farley, also, of Boston.</p>

<p>Judge Wilde has been in his present office nearly thirty-two years,
a longer time it is believed than any individual ever held that office
before,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and his judicial career has uniformly been characterized
by legal learning and stern integrity. His personal character is
marked by uncommon frankness and great simplicity of manners.</p>

<p>He has received the degree of Doctor of Laws from Bowdoin
and Harvard Colleges, and he is also a Member of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences, and some other literary associations.</p>


<h3>NATHANIEL WRIGHT, ESQ., OF CINCINNATI, OHIO.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Nathaniel Wright</span> was born Jan. 28, 1789, in the east parish
of Hanover, N.&nbsp;H. The family residence was on the highlands
adjoining the western base of Moose mountain, over which his
father's farm extended. From some of the fields can be seen,
spread out in the distance, nearly half the state of Vermont, rising
in regular gradation from the Connecticut river, with every variety
of cottage, field, woodland, and hill, to the summits of the Green
Mountains, Killington Peak, and Camel's Rump, in the distant horizon.
His parents, Nathaniel Wright and Mary Page, were originally
from Coventry in the state of Connecticut. The name of his paternal
grandfather was the same with that of his father; but we are
not able to trace back the genealogy further. They were all farmers
by occupation. His father was one of the first settlers of Hanover,
and took possession of his farm there, while it was a perfect wilderness,
the occupancy of which he had to contest with wild beasts.
The sylvan adventures of that period were, no doubt, the topic of
many a fireside tale of his childhood. His mother was sister of
the father of Harlan Page, distinguished for his active piety, and of
tract-distribution memory.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright began fitting for college in 1806. The larger part
of his preparatory studies were with the Rev. Eden Burroughs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
D. D., the parish minister, long one of the Trustees of Dartmouth
College, and celebrated as the father of the notorious Stephen
Burroughs, who died in Canada, a Catholic priest. He entered the
Freshman class of Dartmouth College at the commencement of
1807, and graduated in 1811. After graduating, he spent three years
or more in teaching, being part of that time in charge of the Portland
Academy, Maine, and part of the time in charge of a select
class of boys in the same place; and began there the study of
law. He then spent a year as private tutor in a family in Virginia,
reading law in the mean time, and was admitted to the bar
in that state. In July, 1817, he went to Cincinnati, where, after
spending some time in an office to familiarize himself with local
practice, he was admitted to the bar in November, 1817, and commenced
the practice in 1818. For a few years, he practised in the
Federal Courts, and in different parts of the state; but finding the
city practice the most profitable, as well as most pleasant, he soon
confined himself to that, and continued it with so much labor and
assiduity, that, in 1839 and 1840, he found his health giving way
under the effects of it, and in the latter year, withdrew from the
practice. Of his success in the practice, he has had no reason to
complain. And in talents and legal acquirements, he has ranked
with the first in the state.</p>

<p>He has been solicited at different times to become a candidate
for Judge of the Supreme Court of Ohio, and for Member of Congress;
but has uniformly refused all nominations for political office,
preferring a private life to all others.</p>

<p>In April, 1820, he married Caroline Augusta Thew, a niece of
the Hon. Jacob Burnet of Cincinnati. Her mother was a daughter
of Dr. William Burnet of Newark, N. J., a surgeon in the army
in the Revolutionary war, and a man of distinction in that state.
Her parents being both dead, she went from Newark to Cincinnati
with Judge Burnet's family, in 1815.</p>

<p>The children of these parents are eight in number: Mary Thew,
Caroline Augusta, Daniel Thew, Eliza Burnet, Augusta Caroline,
Louisa, Nathaniel, and William Burnet. Of these, Caroline Augusta
and Augusta Caroline died, the former at five, the latter at
three years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. Wright has published nothing, that can properly be called a
book; yet many of his writings have appeared in public print in
various forms. His name appears at the head of some important
arguments in the Law Reports of Ohio, during the period of his
practice; and some of his occasional addresses have been printed.
In early life he was a lover of poetry, and not unfrequently
attempted to honor the Muses; and this he did always with
applause.</p>

<p>When Mr. Wright went to Cincinnati, then having five or six
thousand inhabitants, he sat down patiently with the young at the
foot of the bar, went on through a generation of the profession, till
he stood at its head; and saw the city grown up to a population of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
80,000, himself standing among a few <em>old</em> respectable inhabitants,
easy in circumstances, with a very happy family around him, and
highly respected by the community.&mdash;The late Rev. Chester Wright,
a graduate at Middlebury College in 1805, and of Montpelier,
Vt., was his half-brother.</p>


<h3>HON. WILLIAM D. WILLIAMSON OF BANGOR, ME.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">William Durkee Williamson</span> is supposed to be a descendant,
in the sixth generation, of one who was among the earliest settlers
in the Plymouth Colony. For as the Annalist tells us,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> when
Gov. Winslow went to make his first treaty with Massasoit,
March 22, 1621, he was preceded by "Captain Standish and <em>Mr.
Williamson</em>," and attended by a file of "musketeers." Nothing
farther appears, in the printed narratives of those times, concerning
the man last mentioned; nor is there any positive knowledge of his
immediate posterity; though it is a report of tradition, that one of
his name had command of a company in King Philip's war, in
1675-6, who might have been his son. But, however this may have
been, certain it is, that men of his name in succeeding generations
have exhibited a predilection for military tactics; and that in Major
Benjamin Church's fifth expedition eastward, 1704, Captain <em>Caleb
Williamson</em> commanded a company of volunteers from Plymouth
Colony. He had one brother, whose name was <em>George</em>, and the
place of their residence was Harwich, in the county of Barnstable.
It is said there was another of the family, or kindred, perhaps a
brother, by the name of <em>Samuel</em>, who settled at Hartford in Connecticut,
but as he left no son, his name at his death sank into
oblivion.</p>

<p>George Williamson, above named, married, at Harwich, the
daughter of a Mr. Crisp; and they had two sons, George and
Caleb, and five daughters. The elder son was murdered by a
highwayman, and left no child; the younger, born at that place,
1716, married Sarah Ransom, and settled at Middleborough in the
county of Plymouth; whose children were six sons and three
daughters. Though five of the sons were married, only two of them,
Caleb and George, left issue. The latter, being the fifth son, born in
1754, who was the father of the subject of this sketch, removed
with his father's family at the commencement of the Revolutionary
war, to Canterbury, Ct., and married Mary Foster of that place, a
niece of Rev. Jacob Foster, formerly a minister of Berwick, Me.
Their children were four sons and four daughters. The sons are
William D., the subject of this sketch; George, a farmer at Pittston;
and Joseph, a lawyer at Belfast, a graduate at Vermont University,
and President of the Senate, in the Legislature of Maine. Their
father was a soldier in the Revolution, and a captain of artillery,
some years after the peace. In 1793, he removed from Canterbury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
where his sons were born, to Amherst, Ms., and finally died at
Bangor, in 1822, aged 68 years.</p>

<p>William D., his eldest son, entered Williams College, in 1800;
but finished his studies at Brown University, R. I., where he was
graduated in 1804. As his father was a farmer in moderate
circumstances, and himself the eldest of eight children, he was
under the necessity of teaching a school several winters, to defray
his college expenses. He read law with Hon. S. F. Dickinson of
Amherst, till the spring of 1807, when he took up his residence in
Bangor, Me., where he completed his professional studies with J.
McGaw, Esq., being admitted to the bar in November of that
year. Jan. 14, 1808, he was commissioned by Gov. Sullivan
Attorney for the county of Hancock, an office held by him about
eight years, when the county was divided. In 1816, he was elected
to the Senate of Massachusetts, Maine being then a part of the
Commonwealth; and received successive elections, till the separation
in 1820. Though as a political man, his sentiments were of
a democratic character, adverse to the majority in each of the legislative
branches, he was Chairman of the Committee of Eastern
Lands, three years. He was President of the first Senate in the
new state of Maine; and the appointment of Gov. King as a Commissioner
on the Spanish Claims, brought him into the Executive
Chair, about six months of the political year. In the meantime, he
was elected a Member of Congress. After he left the field of
legislation he was appointed a Judge of Probate for his county, a
Justice of Peace through the state, and President of Bangor Bank.</p>

<p>Judge Williamson was thrice married. He was first connected in
marriage with J. M. Rice, an orphan, the niece of Gen. Montague
of Amherst, whose home was hers. Five children were the fruits
of this marriage, one of whom, an only son, a promising youth,
died in 1832, at the close of his Junior year in Bowdoin College.
His second wife was the eldest daughter of Judge Phinehas White
of Putney, Vt., and his third was the only surviving daughter of
the late E. Emerson, Esq., York, Me.</p>

<p>Judge Williamson was fond of literary pursuits generally, but
particularly of historical research. He wrote and published a
number of articles on various subjects, in different periodicals. His
great work, however, which cost him many years of labor, was his
History of Maine, in two large octavo volumes. He died May 27,
1846.</p>

<p>"They [the Fathers of N. E.] were mostly men of good estates and families,
of liberal education, and of large experience; but they chiefly excelled in piety

OF HIS SECOND CONSORT.</a></h2>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Thomas Hinckley was the last Governor of the Plymouth Colony, which office he held,
except during the interruption by Andros, from 1680 to 1692, when that colony was joined
to the Massachusetts colony. He was a man of worth and piety. The following lines, composed
by him on the death of his second wife, are copied from one of three volumes of the
manuscripts of Rev. Thomas Prince, which are now in the possession of the Rev. Chandler
Robbins of this city.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to inform our readers, that Thomas Prince, colleague pastor of the
Old South Church in Boston from Oct. 1, 1718, to Oct. 22, 1758, was a most diligent and
careful collector of public and private papers, relating to the religious and civil history of
New England, and that many of his valuable books and manuscripts have been deposited by
the church to which he ministered, in the library of the Massachusetts Historical Society.</p>

<p>The following brief sketch of the connection between Thomas Prince and Gov. Hinckley,
and of some of the descendants of the latter, may be appropriate as an introduction to this
poetic effusion.</p>

<p>In the manuscript volume above referred to, Rev. Thomas Prince has recorded a genealogical
table prepared by himself, in which he states that he was "the fourth son of Samuel
Prince, Esq., of Sandwich, who was the son of Elder John Prince, who came over in 1633,
and settled first at Watertown and afterwards at Hull, who was the eldest son of Rev. John
Prince of East Shefford, in Berkshire, Eng., who was born of honorable parents, educated
in the University of Oxford, and was one of the Puritan ministers of the Church of England
who <em>in part conformed</em>."</p>

<p>The father of Rev. Thomas Prince, Samuel Prince, Esq., married in 1686, for his second
wife, Mercy Hinckley, the eldest daughter of Governor Hinckley by his second wife.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
They had ten children; namely, Thomas, Mary, Enoch, John, Joseph, Moses, Nathan, Mercy,
Alice, Benjamin.</p>

<p>Thomas married Deborah Denny. One of their daughters became the wife of Lieut.
Governor Gill.</p>

<p>Mary married the Rev. Peter Thatcher.</p>

<p>Moses married Jane Bethune. Their daughter, Jane Prince, was consort of the Rev.
Chandler Robbins, D. D., of Plymouth, Ms., grandfather of the Rev. Chandler Robbins of
Boston, of whom we have obtained this relic of antiquity.]</p></div>

<p>The following is an extract from one of the manuscript volumes of the Rev. Mr. Prince:</p>

<h2><a name="BIOGRAPHICAL_NOTICES_OF_PHYSICIANS_IN_KINGSTON" id="BIOGRAPHICAL_NOTICES_OF_PHYSICIANS_IN_KINGSTON">BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES OF PHYSICIANS IN KINGSTON,
N.&nbsp;H.</a></h2>


<p>The first Physician of Kingston of whom we have any definite account, was
a <em>Dr. Green</em>, who died some time in the year 1750. The vacancy created by
his death was filled by <em>Dr. Josiah Bartlett</em> and <em>Dr. Aaron Sawyer</em>. Dr. Sawyer
soon returned to the Upper Parish of Amesbury, Ms., whence he originated.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Josiah Bartlett</em> was born in Amesbury, Ms., Nov. 21, 1727, O. S. His
father, whose name was Stephen Bartlett, had not much property, but was, however,
enabled to give him a medical education under the instruction of Dr.
Ordway, a respectable physician of Amesbury. Dr. Bartlett completed his
medical studies at the age of twenty-one, and very soon after established himself
at Kingston, N.&nbsp;H.</p>

<p>He married his cousin, Mary Bartlett, of Newtown, N.&nbsp;H., Jan. 15, 1754, by
whom he had twelve children.</p>

<p>His practice became very extensive, and he was eminently successful,
especially in the treatment of the <em>Cynanche Maligna</em>, or Throat Distemper,
which first made its appearance in Kingston, with great fatality, in 1765.</p>

<p>Dr. Bartlett began his political career as Representative from Kingston, in the
Legislature of New Hampshire, while an English colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>He continued to fill various offices of trust, from this time to the year 1775,
when he was elected to the Continental Congress, which met at Philadelphia
in September of that year. In July, 1776, Congress declared the Colonies
independent, and Dr. Bartlett was the first, after the venerable Hancock, to
sign this instrument of American freedom.</p>

<p>In November, 1778, Dr. Bartlett returned home to attend to his domestic affairs,
which had suffered greatly from his absence. About this time he was appointed
Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and was transferred to the Superior
Bench in November, 1782, and there officiated till he was appointed, in
1788, Chief Justice of the State. Judge Bartlett sustained, during this period,
many offices not incompatible with his high judicial character, such as Counsellor,
a member of the Convention to form a State Constitution, and was one of
a Committee, with Judge Livermore and Gen. Sullivan, to revise the Laws of
the State, and a member of the Convention to ratify the new Constitution.</p>

<p>In 1789, he was elected Senator to Congress, but his declining health, and
the depression of spirits consequent upon the sudden death of his wife, early
in that year, induced him to decline the duties of Senator, and to resign the
office of Chief Justice.</p>

<p>The people, unwilling to lose his services, elected him President of the State,
in 1790.</p>

<p>Dr. Bartlett took an active part in forming the New Hampshire Medical
Society, and was elected, in 1791, its first President.</p>

<p>In 1792, he was chosen a member to revise the Constitution of New Hampshire,
in which the title of President was dropped, and that of Governor substituted,
and he was the first Chief Magistrate with the title of Governor. About
this time, he received the honorary degrees of M. A. and M. D. from Dartmouth
College.</p>

<p>Gov. Bartlett filled all these stations with general satisfaction, without ostentation;
administering the laws in a mild yet decisive manner, and setting forth
the example of true republicanism.</p>

<p>His appointments were just, and such as met the public approbation.</p>

<p>The arduous duties of a professional and political life, in those "times that
tried men's souls," had impaired his health, and so shattered a constitution,
never strong, that May 19, 1795, he died suddenly, of paralysis, leaving a very
extensive circle of friends to mourn his departure.</p>

<p>Gov. Bartlett was possessed of good mental powers, of a kind and benevolent
disposition, and was scrupulously just in all his dealings.</p>

<p>Philanthropy and benevolence were the prominent traits of his character.</p>

<p>His letters, still extant, show that, with a calm and childlike trust in God, he
mingled that high sense of the responsibilities which man owes to his Creator
and his fellow-man, which forms the foundation of a truly generous, just, and
noble character.</p>

<p>Subjoined is the testimony of one who was his neighbor and intimate friend
for many years&mdash;the Rev. Dr. Elihu Thayer. It is taken from the Address
delivered at the funeral of Gov. Bartlett.</p>

<p>"But few persons by their own merit, without the influence of family, or
party connections, have risen from one degree of honor and confidence to another,
as he did. And <em>fewer still</em> have been the instances, in which a succession
of honorable and important offices even to the highest, have been held by
<em>any man</em> with <em>less envy</em>; or executed with <em>more general</em> approbation. Despising
the gaudy exhibition of vain parade, (a sure mark of a noble mind,) he set a
shining example of frugality and economy, both in private and public life, at a
period when such virtues were peculiarly becoming and necessary. His natural
temper was open, humane, and compassionate. In his dealings, he was
scrupulously just, and faithful in the performance of all his engagements; and
in his public offices, he served his country with all his might."</p>

<p>The children of Gov. Bartlett who still survive, are Hon. Ezra Bartlett of
Haverhill. N.&nbsp;H., and Mrs. Gale, the widow of the late Dr. Amos Gale of Kingston.
She is in her 74th year, and resides at South Hampton with her daughter,
Mrs. White.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Levi Bartlett</em> was the eldest son of Gov. Josiah Bartlett, and was born
Sept. 3, 1763. He received his preparatory education at the then celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
"Dummer School" in Newbury, Ms., and after studying the science of medicine
one year with his father, he completed his professional course with Dr.
Thomas Kittredge of Andover, Ms., a distinguished physician.</p>

<p>Soon after, he established himself in Kingston, N.&nbsp;H., where his father had
been located, and who was giving up his professional business to younger and
more vigorous practitioners.</p>

<p>Here, and in the adjoining towns, he soon acquired an extensive practice,
and was frequently called many miles from home in consultation. He was a
skilful and successful surgeon, and performed many important operations.</p>

<p>Dr. Bartlett filled many stations of trust. He was a Justice of the Peace and
Quorum throughout the state, Colonel in the militia, and Post Master for many
years. He frequently represented Kingston in the Legislature, and for several
years was a member of the Council, and Chief Justice of the Court of Common
Pleas. But being of a studious and metaphysical turn, he preferred the quiet
pleasures of private life to the care and turmoil of the political arena.</p>

<p>He was married, Nov. 6, 1791, to Sally Hook, who died of consumption, February,
1793. He married the second time, Abigail Stevens, April 18, 1807.</p>

<p>He was kind and obliging in his disposition, generous and humane to the
needy, and honorable and just in all his business relations.</p>

<p>For several years, he suffered from paralysis, and was, consequently, unable to
transact business or enjoy life. His earthly career terminated Jan. 30, 1828, at
the age of 65, leaving a widow and three children&mdash;two daughters and one son.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Levi Stevens Bartlett</em> was born Dec. 3, 1811. He received his academical
education at Phillips Academy, Exeter. He read medicine with his
uncle, the late Hon. Josiah Bartlett of Stratham, Professor Elisha Bartlett, at
that time of Lowell, Ms., and with Dr. John Barrett of Portland, Me. Dr.
Bartlett attended the Medical Lectures at Dartmouth and Bowdoin Colleges,
and received his diploma from Dartmouth in the year 1832, a short time before
he was 21 years of age.</p>

<p>Having come in possession of the landed estates of his father, and the old
mansion of his grandfather, he settled at Kingston, where he now resides, and
is in the practice of his profession. He married, Dec. 3, 1844, Aroline E.,
daughter of Moses Sanborn, Esq.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Amos Gale</em>, son of Jacob Gale, was born at East Kingston, April 9, 1744,
0. S. He studied medicine with Dr. Josiah Bartlett of Kingston, N.&nbsp;H., and
married Hannah, the only child of Daniel and Hannah Gilman of Kingston,
Nov. 12, 1765. They had ten children, six sons and four daughters, six of
whom are still living. His practice was very extensive, and he was highly
esteemed as a physician and citizen. He was one of the early members of the
N.&nbsp;H. Medical Society, and he continued to practice medicine in Kingston and
vicinity, (with the exception of a few years, during which he resided in Troy,
N. Y.,) until a short time before his death, which occurred June 8, 1813, aged
69 years. The disease which terminated his life was paralysis. Several young
men received their medical instruction from him.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Amos Gale, Jr.</em>, son of the preceding, was born at Kingston, Oct. 15, 1768.
He studied medicine with his father and Dr. Levi Bartlett of Kingston, attended
lectures at Boston, commenced and continued to practise medicine in his native
town till his death, which occurred Dec. 7, 1824, aged 56 years. He was a
very energetic and athletic man, and was characterized for his great assiduity
and self-denial in the discharge of his duties as a physician. He was married
to Sally, youngest daughter of Gov. Bartlett, by whom he had seven children,
five sons and two daughters, all of whom are still living. Dr. Gale held various
offices in the town, and was Representative to the Legislature in 1808.
About twenty young men received medical education under his instruction.
He was elected a member of the N.&nbsp;H. Medical Society in 1800.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Stephen Gale</em>, youngest son of Dr. Amos Gale, Senior, was born Jan. 28,
1723, and studied medicine with his brother Amos. He died Aug. 13, 1804.
His disease was a scrofulous affection of the knee, caused by an injury.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Ezra Bartlett Gale</em>, eldest son of Dr. Amos Gale, Jr., was born at Kingston,
Oct. 13, 1797. He studied medicine with his father and uncle, Dr. Levi
Bartlett, and attended medical lectures in Boston in 1818, and practised with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
father till July, 1821, when he commenced practice in Brentwood, N.&nbsp;H., and
continued there till August, 1823. In the fall of 1822, he attended a course of
Medical Lectures at Brown University, and received the degree of M. D. in
1823. He married Ruth White, youngest daughter of the late Richard White,
Esq., of South Hampton, N.&nbsp;H., July 31, 1823, where he practised medicine till
1827, when he recommenced practice in Kingston, in which place he now pursues
his professional duties. He had seven children by his first wife, four sons
and three daughters, all of whom are living. His wife died July 6, 1841. He
married Emily, daughter of the late Moses Atwood, Esq., of Atkinson, Nov. 22,
1842, by whom he has two daughters. He is a member and officer of the N.
H. Medical Society, and also of the Rockingham Dist. Med. Society.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Levi Bartlett Gale</em>, second son of Dr. Amos Gale, Jr., was born Aug. 29,
1800. He studied medicine with his father and brother, and attended lectures
at Boston and at Brown University, where he took his degree of M. D. He
commenced and continued the practice of medicine in Kingston till the return
of his brother from South Hampton, when he removed to Boston, where he now
resides. He married Sarah B. Keggan, by whom he has two children.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Josiah Bartlett Gale</em>, third son of Dr. Amos Gale, Jr., was born Jan. 11,
1803. He studied medicine with his brothers Ezra Bartlett and Levi Bartlett
Gale. He attended Medical Lectures at Brown University, and commenced
the practice of medicine in Brentwood, where he remained but a short time.
Thence he removed to Salisbury Mills, Ms., where he now resides. He married
Hannah, daughter of the late Capt. Jacob Morrill of Salisbury, Ms. They
have one child, a son.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Amos Gilman Gale</em>, fourth son of Dr. Amos Gale, Jr., was born Feb. 17,
1807. He commenced his medical studies with his brother Levi Bartlett Gale,
and attended two courses of Medical Lectures at Dartmouth College, at which
he received the degree of M. D. He commenced the practice of medicine in
Hooksett, N.&nbsp;H., where he was employed in his profession till his removal to
Manchester, N.&nbsp;H. He married Mary, daughter of Hon. Richard H. Ayer, of
Hooksett, by whom he has one child, a daughter.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Stephen Madison Gale</em>, fifth son of Dr. Amos Gale, Jr., was born in Kingston,
Oct. 20, 1809. He commenced the study of medicine with his brother E.
B. Gale, in 1834, studied one year with his brother L. B. Gale in Boston, and
attended three courses of Medical Lectures in that place three years in succession,
commencing in 1834, and received his medical degree at Harvard University,
1837. He commenced practice in Derry, N.&nbsp;H., September following; and
thence he removed to East Kingston, where he remained but a short time. He
commenced practice in Lowell, Dec. 1838, and from that place he removed to
Methuen, July, 1839, where he has been engaged in practice ever since. He
was admitted a Fellow of the Massachusetts Medical Society, April, 1839. He
married Hannah W. Johnson of Portland, Me., March 28, 1843, by whom he has
one daughter, Alice Bartlett.</p>

<p>Though all the above physicians by the name of Gale have not been located
as physicians in Kingston, yet, as they were all of one family, we have entered
their names under the head of Kingston.</p>

<p>There has been for about eighty years in Kingston a physician of the name
of Gale, father, son, and grandsons. Very much the same may be said of the
name of Bartlett. It is believed that no two families in our country have furnished
more physicians than the Bartlett and Gale families of Kingston. Governor
Bartlett had three sons eminent as physicians; namely, Josiah of Stratham,
Levi of Kingston, and Ezra of Haverhill, all members and officers of the
Medical Society; and all political men, Ezra and Levi having been Judges of
Courts, and Josiah a Member of Congress. Many of his grandsons are in the
profession, one of whom, Dr. Josiah Bartlett of Stratham, is now President of the
New Hampshire Medical Society.</p>

<p><em>Dr. Thomas Bassett</em> was born in Deerfield, N.&nbsp;H., Aug. 12, 1797. His father
was a merchant in that town, and once traded in Atkinson; but in 1804
removed to Londonderry with his family, where he resided till his death. His
mother's name was Susannah McGregore, a descendant of the Rev. James
McGregore, who emigrated from Scotland to Ireland, and subsequently with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
a number of others, to America, and commenced a settlement in Londonderry.
At the age of fifteen, Thomas commenced the studies preparatory to entering college,
under the instruction of his uncle, Rev. David McGregore, who was then the
settled minister in Bedford, N.&nbsp;H., and lived with him about three years; he then
left and entered the Pinkerton Academy in Derry, under the tuition of Mr.
Samuel Burnham, and continued there until the death of his father. At this
time, finding himself destitute of pecuniary means, he was forced to relinquish
the idea of prosecuting further his collegiate studies, and resorted to school-keeping
to obtain the object he then most desired, an education. After spending
three years in this employment, he resolved to prepare for the medical
profession; and, in 1821, entered the office of Dr. George Farrar of Derry, as a
student in medicine, where he remained till the fall of 1822, when he left, and
entered the private class of Professors Mussey, Oliver, and Dana, at Dartmouth
College, and continued with them until he had finished a regular course of
medical instruction, and received the degree of Doctor in Medicine at the
Commencement, in 1824. In March following, he established himself at
Kingston, as a physician and surgeon, where he has resided, with the exception
of a few months, to the present time, in the practice of his profession,
in that place and the neighboring towns.</p>

<p>In 1828, he was married to Miranda Spofford, daughter of Samuel Spofford,
and granddaughter of Major Jacob Peaslee of Kingston. In 1826 he was
elected, and in 1837, became a Fellow of the N.&nbsp;H. Medical Society, in which
he has held the office of Censor and Counsellor. He has been honored with
the office of Justice of the Peace, and has held the office of Brigade Major and
Inspector in the first Brigade of New Hampshire militia.</p>

<h2><a name="ANNIVERSARY_OF_THE_NEW_ENGLAND_SOCIETY_OF" id="ANNIVERSARY_OF_THE_NEW_ENGLAND_SOCIETY_OF">ANNIVERSARY OF THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY OF
CINCINNATI, O.</a></h2>


<p>The 226th Anniversary of the Landing of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, was
celebrated in the City of Cincinnati by the New England Society, on Dec. 22,
1846. The services on the occasion were as follows: Prayer by the Rev. Dr.
Beecher; Reading the Scriptures by the Rev. Mr. Magoon; Address by B. B.
Fessenden, Esq.; Benediction by Rev. Dr. Stowe. With these services appropriate
music was interspersed.</p>

<p>On Jan. 5, 1847, the annual meeting of the Society was held, and the Report
was read by the Rev. Dr. Colton. In the Cincinnati Gazette we find the following
account, which, we doubt not, will be interesting to our readers.</p>

<p>This Society was organized January 14th, 1845. Its objects are, to cherish
the memory and perpetuate the principles of the original settlers of New England;
to collect and diffuse information respecting New England and New
England emigrants to other parts of the country, especially to the West; and to
extend charity to the needy of New England descent. It is composed of men
born in New England, and the male descendants of New England ancestors.
The Society has a liberal charter from the Legislature, and is wholly free from
debt. It has upwards of 200 members, and the number is rapidly increasing,
23 having joined at the last meeting.</p>

<p>It was voted to appropriate one half the surplus in the Treasury towards the
establishment of a valuable library of historical and antiquarian works in relation
to New England, and to start a subscription of $500 in aid of the project,
of which $200 was immediately subscribed, and it is thought the balance can be
made up this month. A catalogue of the works desired has been made out,
which, we trust, the Directors will be enabled at once to purchase. The income
of the Society this year, if this subscription is filled, will amount to $1,100.</p>

<p>A Committee was appointed, to ascertain if a course of Lectures could be
prepared in time to be delivered this winter.</p>

<p>The Society contemplates the erection ultimately of a Hall for their library,
meetings, and lectures, for which a lot has been offered on liberal conditions.</p>

<p>The following gentlemen were elected officers for the ensuing year, (Mr.
<span class="smcap">Starr</span> having declined re&euml;lection as President.)</p>

<p><em>For President</em>, Timothy Walker. <em>For Vice-President</em>, Lot E. Brewster. <em>For
Corresponding Secretary</em>, Chauncey Colton. <em>For Recording Secretary</em>, Henry
Crane. <em>For Treasurer</em>, James Lakey. <em>For Directors</em>, Henry Starr, Edmund
Gage, Melzer Flagg, Maynard French, Jonathan H. Niles, Wm. Wiswell, Jr.</p>

<p>The following gentlemen have been the Presidents and Vice-Presidents, since
its formation:</p>

<p>1845.&mdash;Bellamy Storer, <em>President</em>. Ephraim Robbins and Henry Emerson,
<em>Vice-Presidents</em>.</p>

<p>1846.&mdash;Henry Starr, <em>President</em>. Lot E. Brewster, <em>Vice-President</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a neat 12mo of about 400 pages, "designed to present such historical facts
connected with our early history, and descriptions of interesting localities with which
they are connected, as are deemed of essential importance to the numerous visitors
who resort to the spot, rendered memorable as the scene where the foundations of
republican institutions were first laid in this western world, and the principles of religious
and civil liberty were successfully established in New England." The design of
the author has been accomplished. Although much novelty can hardly be expected in
relation to subjects which have already become trite, though not uninteresting, yet by
a judicious collection of facts and a pleasing presentation of them, the work is well adapted
to engage the attention of the reader, and to furnish him with the information desired.
It commences with a brief detail of the circumstances, which led our Pilgrim Fathers
to leave the land of their birth and embark for a country of pathless wildernesses,
abounding in savage beasts and still more savage men. It follows them in their voyage,
through storms and perils to them unknown before; it describes their arrival at Cape
Cod, the sufferings, privations, and hardships they endured, and the subsequent increase
and growth of the infant Colony, all in a manner highly instructive. The various
places of interest to a traveller in the town of Plymouth are distinctly and minutely
pointed out, and many matters of importance are related concerning them. Several
ancient documents of great value are also inserted, together with some notice of the
Pilgrims. The volume closes with a collection of Hymns and Songs, selected from
the productions of our best authors, composed with express reference to Anniversary
Celebrations in Plymouth and other parts of the United States. The work is embellished
with a map of Plymouth village in 1846, a frontispiece engraving of the town
and harbor of Plymouth, also several other designs. It is a book eminently useful to
the traveller, and valuable to the historian.</p></div>

<p><cite>The History of Charlestown, Massachusetts. By Richard Frothingham, Jr.
"The History of a Town is united with that of the Country to which it belongs,
and with that of the ages through which it has stood."</cite> Charlestown: Charles P.
Emmons. Boston: Charles C. Little and James Brown. 1845.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is a work issued in numbers of about 50 pages each. The author states, in the
commencement, his sources of information to be, the town Records; Records of the
first church in the town; the Colony Records; the Probate and Registry Records; and
private collections of papers. From such materials we should think a most perfect history
can be made. We are pleased to see an interest arising in the minds of many, concerning
our local or town histories, for by this means only can that of the state be
rendered accurate. "Each town has some noted spot where the Indian may have
fought for his burial-places, or the colonists for their freedom; that may have sheltered
a hermit or a regicide; that superstition may have invested with a fairy legend, or
nature have robed with more than fairy magnificence. Each has its Liberty Tree, its
Green Dragon, its Faneuil Hall, where its patriots may have counselled or acted. And
each has had citizens who laid its foundations, perhaps in hardship and danger." It is
for the local annalist to gather these traditions and facts, from which the state historian
may form a comprehensive and accurate account. This work is embellished with
quite a number of interesting engravings. Four numbers have appeared, containing
much useful and curious matter, and we hope soon to see the remainder. The work
is highly deserving public patronage, and we hope that Charlestown and its vicinity
especially, will amply reward the author for his indefatigable labors.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This is decidedly a valuable work. The name of the author alone would guarantee
an elaborate, and, so far as within his ability, a strictly accurate publication. It presents
Massachusetts in a statistical, historical, and topographical light, and is filled with such
matter as would be deeply interesting to the antiquary, and the man of business,
indeed to all in Massachusetts who take any pleasure in knowing the condition and
prosperity of their own state. It is a work useful for reference in regard to education,
internal improvements, matters of commercial importance&mdash;and may be regarded as
a universal Gazetteer. We cheerfully commend it to the patronage of the public.</p></div>

<p><cite>Epitaphs from the Old Burying-Ground in Cambridge. With Notes, by William
Thaddeus Harris, Junior Sophister in Harvard College.</cite> Cambridge: Published
by John Owen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It has been, and still is, the disposition of the public, to regard the resting-places of
the deceased with aversion, rather than with pleasurable interest. This we think
should not be the case. "Forget not the faithful dead" is worthy to be inscribed at the
entrance of every cemetery, and these, instead of being permitted to run to waste,
should be adorned, and made pleasing to the sight. Thus the grave may be divested of
its gloom, and the graveyard, now an object of terror, may become frequented as a
place for calm, serious, and profitable meditation.</p>

<p>In this volume a complete transcript is made of the epitaphs in the burying-ground,
from 1653 to the year 1800; but in the years succeeding 1800, with a few exceptions,
the names only of those, to whose memory monuments have been erected, are given.
In addition to these, which are 670 in number, there are brief notices of many, whose
monumental inscriptions are given. A table, also, of the deaths of many, whose monuments
have crumbled to dust, or whose remains were deposited in tombs, is appended.
It is a volume of 192 pages, octavo, printed at the University press, and must be interesting
to those who delight in curious and antiquated matters. We hope others will
be induced to prepare like collections from those spots where,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This volume is the <em>eightieth</em> of the Massachusetts Register, and its value as a work of
reference will, we think, be appreciated by the public for as many years to come. Such
a work is much needed by all classes of business men throughout the state. It comprises
statistics of civil officers; professional men; societies and associations, literary,
scientific, religious, and benevolent; commerce; mercantile affairs; naval and military
officers; courts and justices; institutions of learning, and also those for benevolent
purposes; corporations of all kinds. It is literally <i lang="la">multum in parvo</i>. Mr. Loring, who
has much of a historical taste, deserves great praise for his endeavors to render it accurate
and useful; and it should have an extensive circulation in the state.</p>

<p>The publishers of the Register have been as follows:</p>

<p>In 1767, Mein and Fleming, at the London Bookstore, north side of King street, now
State street; in 1774, Mills and Hicks, School street, next door to Brackett's Tavern,
sign of Cromwell's Head; in 1779, Thomas and John Fleet, sign of the Bible and Heart,
corner of Cornhill and Water street; in 1801, John West and Manning and Loring, until
1813, when its publishers were West, Richardson, and Lord, and the present publisher,
who has been a proprietor for forty-six years past.</p></div>

<p><cite>A Statistical View of the Population of Massachusetts, from 1765 to 1840. By
Jesse Chickering.</cite> Boston: Charles C. Little and James Brown. 1846. pp. 160.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The object of this essay is to exhibit the increase of the population of Massachusetts,
and the changes which have taken place in the number and proportion of the
inhabitants in the several parts of the Commonwealth, during the period of seventy-five
years from 1765 to 1840." "The censuses consulted in the preparation of this work
are the Colonial census, ordered in 1764 and finished in 1765, and the six censuses of
the United States, taken at intervals of ten years, from 1790 to 1840." The number of
inhabitants in Massachusetts in 1765, from various calculations is estimated at 244,149,
exclusive of 1,569 Indians. In 1790, according to the United States census published
in 1791, the population was 378,787, which is adopted as the true number; in 1800 it
was 422,845; in 1810, 472,040; in 1820, 523,287; in 1830, 610,408; and in 1840, 737,700.</p>

<p>The U. S. censuses of 1790, 1800, and 1820 were taken August 1st; and those of
1810, 1830, and 1840 were taken July 1st; so that the intervals between the second and
third, and the fourth and fifth were two months <em>less</em> than ten years, while that between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the third and fourth was two months <em>more</em> than ten years. These differences in the
length of the intervals affect the numerical results, but so slightly, as not to be materially
important in the comparative results, especially for so long a period as from 1790
to 1840. The least increase discovered in any period is in that embracing the time
from 1810 to 1820; probably owing in some degree to the war then existing with Great
Britain and the emigration of many citizens to the West. In the period from 1765 to
1790, the increase was greater than it has ever been.</p>

<p>The increase of Boston, in proportion to its inhabitants, from 1765 to 1790 was very
much less than that of the country towns, while from 1790 to 1840 it was very much
greater, thus showing the modern tendency to centralization. Besides the great amount
of statistical matter of which the above is an exceedingly brief epitome, it contains a
table showing the average number of inhabitants in each year, according to the U. S.
censuses, together with the increase, on the supposition of a uniform rate of increase
in each year, the same being carried on to 1850, at the rate of increase from 1830 to
1840. Much other valuable matter is contained in this publication; manifestly of great
labor and of apparent accuracy. Such a work as this of Dr. Chickering was much
needed to rectify the many errors which had arisen in the taking and computing the
censuses. We only add, that could such a statistical view be taken of every state in
the Union, many important facts would be discovered and many data be obtained, from
which inferences might perhaps be drawn greatly interesting and useful.</p></div>

<p><cite>A Discourse delivered before The Maine Historical Society at its Annual Meeting.
September 6, 1846. By George Folsom. "But I doubt not * * * it will
prove a very flourishing place, and be replenished with many faire Towns and Cities,
it being a Province both fruitful and pleasant."</cite>&mdash;F. Gorges. Description
of the Province of Maine. Portland: Published for the Society. 1847.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The subject of this discourse is the early discovery and settlement of Maine, and the
character of those who were most active in the work of colonization. It clearly indicates
the author to be a man of historical research not only in regard to the state of
Maine, but also in respect to New England and the early settlers generally. It is well
worth the careful perusal, both of those who are fond of historic lore, and those who
are searching for truth; as it contains facts which are important and are not generally
known.</p>

<p>Mr. Folsom concludes his discourse of 75 pages as follows: "In my humble opinion,
Maine owes some public acknowledgment to the memory of Sir Ferdinando Gorges,
for having laid the foundation of its existence as a separate and independent community.
Bradford and Winthrop are names that will never die amongst their successors
at Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay; Pennsylvania will never forget her obligations
to the illustrious Friend of humanity who peopled her wilderness; nor will Georgia
suffer the memory of the enlightened Oglethorpe to perish; Maryland has stamped the
name of Baltimore upon her brilliant commercial metropolis, and North Carolina has
her 'city of Raleigh,' although the projected colony of Sir Walter proved a splendid
failure. And shall Maine do nothing to mark her sense of the merits of the liberal
patron and successful abettor of the first settlements within her limits; who expended
a large fortune upon his projects of discovery and colonization; who, when the country
was abandoned and denounced by others as too cold and dreary for human habitation,
actually hired men to pass the winter here to prove the contrary; and who died
without reaping any substantial return for all his labors and outlays, leaving only a
legacy of lawsuits to his descendants? It is time that justice was done to his memory.
From the small beginning he made, this community has become a widely extended,
populous, and wealthy state&mdash;rich in her resources, and not less distinguished for
the active enterprise and laborious industry of her population. She can well afford to
honor the memory of the man who foresaw all this, and devoted the energies of a long
life to its consummation."</p></div>

<p><cite>The Sin and Danger of Self-Love, described in a Sermon preached at Plymouth,
in New England, 1621, by Robert Cushman. With a Memoir of the Author.</cite>
Boston: Published by Charles Ewer, and for sale by Crocker &amp; Brewster,
Samuel G. Drake, Little &amp; Brown, James Munroe &amp; Company, Benjamin Perkins,
and James Loring. Dec. 22, 1846.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The text from which this sermon was written is, 1 Cor. x.:24. <em>Let no man seek his
own: but every man another's wealth.</em> It is divided into two parts: 1. A <em>Dehortation</em>, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>sisting
of the first clause. 2. An <em>Exhortation</em>, comprising the latter clause. The design
of the discourse was to keep up the noble flow of public spirit in the emigrants, which
perhaps then began to abate, through their accumulating hardships and sufferings, but
which was necessary for their preservation and security. The author exhorts his
hearers to assist each other in their labors and toils, to distribute their property among
those that were needy, and so far as consistent to seek their neighbors' happiness and
prosperity. "The discourse is a precious relic of ancient times. The sound sense,
good advice, and pious spirit, which it manifests, will, it may be hoped, now, and in all
future time, meet with approval and beneficial acceptance in our community." It is
written in the quaint old-fashioned style of our Forefathers, and we noticed that the
last head of remarks, which contains but one sentence, is just a page in length. The
discourse is preceded by a Biographical Sketch of Mr. Cushman, by the late Hon.
John Davis of Boston, together with a letter from him to Charles Ewer, Esq., and a
brief Address by Mr. Cushman to "his Loving Friends the Adventurers for New England,
together with all Well-Willers and Well-Wishers thereunto," dated "Plymouth
in New England, December 12, 1621." These several articles form a pamphlet of 32
pages, well printed, which, on account of its Christian and patriotic principles, should
be generally diffused. For this improved edition, we are indebted to the liberality of
the publisher.</p></div>

1846.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The design of this address seems to be, to illustrate the importance of preserving
the fragmentary and unpublished history of Vermont, a state which for interest in its
early history is surpassed by no other in the Union. Notwithstanding this, however,
it has been greatly neglected. Prof. Butler urges strongly upon the members of the
Society to exert themselves to repair the losses, and give to the world an honorable
account of the Green Mountain State. While others have given partial and one-sided
details of her history, no true son has arisen to vindicate her honor. Says Mr. Butler,
"Let us leave our history to be written by foreigners, and it will be the play of Hamlet
with the part of Hamlet omitted.&mdash;The Genius of history says to us, all and each, that
thou doest do quickly; like the sibyl to the ancient king, she year by year brings with
her fewer and fewer antique records, but unlike the sibyl demands for them an even
increasing price.&mdash;The records of our fathers have in part perished with them,&mdash;some
of them live in the memories of patriarchs, who still stand among us with eyes undimmed
and natural force not abated, as if on purpose that such as hold the pen of the
ready writer may still embalm their sayings.&mdash;Let us redeem the time, since if our
old men pass away unquestioned, no buried Pompeii can be raised from the grave to
enlighten our wilful ignorance." The discourse is interspersed throughout with historical
gems, and in connection with the additional documents forms a valuable production.</p>

<h2>PROSPECTUS<br />

OF THE<br />

NEW ENGLAND<br />

HISTORICAL AND GENEALOGICAL REGISTER.</h2>

<p class="center">REV. WILLIAM COGSWELL, D. D., EDITOR.</p>


<p>The NEW ENGLAND HISTORIC, GENEALOGICAL SOCIETY proposes to
publish by subscription a Quarterly Journal, to be entitled, "<span class="smcap">The New England
Historical and Genealogical Register</span>." The period has arrived in this country,
when an awakened and a growing interest begins to be felt in the pursuit, and
especially in the results, of Historical and Genealogical Researches; and when the
practical value, both to individuals and to society, of the knowledge which is obtained
by investigations of this kind, from the scattered and perishable records of local, domestic,
and traditionary history, begins to be appreciated by increasing numbers. The
existence and active exertions of Historical, Antiquarian, and Statistical Societies,
which have sprung up within a few years past in most of the older states of the Union,
are a sufficient evidence of this fact.</p>

<p>The formation of the <span class="smcap">New England Historic, Genealogical Society</span>, which
has received a Charter from the Massachusetts Legislature, and which, as its name
imports, proposes to direct its attention to the illustration of History in one of its most
elemental and original departments, has been received with a degree of encouragement
and favor, which leaves no room to doubt that a deep interest is felt by many in the
community, in subjects of this nature; and that the materials exist, in various stages
of preparation, as the fruit of personal exertions, for enriching the collections of a general
Depository; and thereby leading to a more extensive diffusion of the facts and
documents, out of which this branch of Literature in our country has yet to be principally
created. The Periodical to be issued by this Society, will be one important
means of accomplishing the end in view. It will comprehend such materials as the
following; namely,</p>

<p>1. Biographical Memoirs, Sketches, and Notices of Persons who came to North
America, especially to New England, before Anno Domini 1700; showing from what
places in Europe they came, their families there, and their descendants in this country;</p>

<p>2. Full and minute Genealogical Memoirs and Tables, showing the lineage and
descent of Families, from the earliest dates to which they can be authentically traced,
down to the present time, with their branches and connections;</p>

<p>3. Tables of Longevity, Statistical and Biographical, Accounts of Attorneys, Physicians,
Ministers and Churches of all denominations, of Graduates at Colleges, Governors,
Senators and Representatives in Congress, Military Officers, Merchants, and
other persons of distinction; and occasionally entire Tracts, which have become rare and
of permanent Historical value;</p>

<p>4. Lists of Names, found in ancient documents, such especially as were engaged in
any honorable public service; also the documents themselves, when they may contain
any important facts illustrative of the lives and actions of individuals;</p>

<p>5. Descriptions of the Costumes, Dwellings, and Utensils of various kinds, belonging
to the earliest times to which the Ancestry of Families may be traced; to be
accompanied, when practicable, with drawings or engravings;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Ancient Inscriptions and Epitaphs, with descriptions of Cemeteries, Monuments,
Tombs, Tablets; also, extracts from the Town and Parish Records of New England;</p>

<p>7. Descriptions of Armorial Bearings, and of other Heraldic devices, occasionally
emblazoned, with sufficient explanations of the principles and terms of Heraldry.</p>

<p>The Publication will embrace many other materials of a Miscellaneous and Statistical
character, more or less connected with its main design; which, it is believed, will
contribute to render it interesting to intelligent persons of every class in the community.</p>

<p>Each Number will be embellished with a Portrait of some distinguished individual.
There will also occasionally be other engravings in the work.</p>
